Some years ago never mind how \nlong precisely having little or no money in my purse, \nand nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought \nI would sail about a little and see the watery part of the \nworld. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and \nregulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself \ngrowing grim about the mouth ; whenever it is a damp, \ndrizzly November in my soul ; whenever I find myself \ninvoluntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bring- \ning up the rear of every funeral I meet ; and especially \nwhenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that \nit requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from \ndeliberately stepping into the street, and methodically \nknocking people's hats off then, I account it high time \nto get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for \npistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws \nhimself upon his sword ; I quietly take to the ship. \nThere is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew \nit, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, \ncherish very nearly the same feelings toward the ocean \nwith me. \n\nThere now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, \nbelted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs \ncommerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the \nstreets take you waterward. Its extreme down -town is the \nbattery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and \n\nVOL. I. A \n\n\n\n2 MOBY-DICK \n\ncooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of \nsight of land. Look at the crowds of water -gazers there. \n\nCircumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath after- \nnoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and \nfrom thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you \nsee ? Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, \nstand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed \nin ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles ; \nsome seated upon the pier-heads ; some looking over \nVhe bulwarks of ships from China ; some high aloft in \nthe rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward \npeep. But these are all landsmen ; of week days pent \nup in lath and plaster tied to counters, nailed to benches, \nclinched to desks. How then is this ? Are the green \nfields gone ? What do they here ? \n\nBut look ! here come more crowds, pacing straight for \nthe water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange ! \nNothing will content them but the extremest limit of the \nland ; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses \nwill not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the \nwater as they possibly can without falling in. And there \nthey stand miles of them leagues. Inlanders all, they \ncome from lanes and alleys, streets and avenues north, \neast, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell me, \ndoes the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses \nof all those ships attract them thither ? \n\nOnce more. Say, you are in the country ; in some \nhigh land of lakes. Take almost any path you please, \nand ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves \nyou there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. \nLet the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his \ndeepest reveries stand that man on his legs, set his feet \na-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water \nthere be in all that region. Should you ever be athirst \nin the great American desert, try this experiment, if your \n\n\n\nLOOMINGS 3 \n\ncaravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical \nprofessor. Yes, as everyone knows, meditation andli \nwater are wedded forever. \n\nBut here is an artist. He desires to paint you the \ndreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of \nromantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco. What \nis the chief element he employs ? There stand his trees, \neach with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix \nwere within ; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep \nhis cattle ; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy \nsmoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, \nreaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in \ntheir hillside blue. But though the picture lies thus \ntranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs \nlike leaves upon this shepherd's head, yet all were \nvain, unless the shepherd's eye were fixed upon the \nmagic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June, \nwhen for scores on scores of miles you wade knee -deep \namong tiger-lilies what is the one charm wanting ?- \nWater there is not a drop of water there ! Were Niagara \nbut a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand \nmiles to see it ? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, \nupon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate \nwhether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or \ninvest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach ? \nWhy is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust \nhealthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to \nsea ? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did \nyou yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first ; \ntold that you and your ship were now out of sight of ' \nland ? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy ? \nWhy did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own \nbrother of Jove ? Surely all this is not without meaning. \nAnd still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, \nwho because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild \n\n\n\n4 MOBY-DICK \n\nimage he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was \ndrowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all \nrivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable \nphantom of life ; and this is the key to it all. \n\nNow, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea \nwhenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin \nto be over conscious of my lungs, I do not mean to have \nit inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to \ngo as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a \npurse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Be- \nsides, passengers get sea-sick grow quarrelsome don't \nsleep of nights do not enjoy themselves much, as a \ngeneral thing ; no, I never go as a passenger ; nor, \nthough I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a \nCommodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the \nglory and distinction of such offices to those who like \nthem. For my part, I abominate all honourable respect- \nable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind what- \nsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care \nof myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, \nschooners, and what not. And as for going as cook, \nthough I confess there is considerable glory in that, a \ncook being a sort of officer on shipboard yet, somehow, \nI never fancied broiling fowls ; though once broiled, \njudiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and \npeppered, there is no one who will speak more respect- \nfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I \nwill. It is out of the idolatrous do tings of the old \nEgyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that \nyou see the mummies of those creatures in their huge \nbake-houses the pyramids. \n\nNo, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right \nbefore the mast, plumb down into the forecastle, aloft \nthere to the royal mast-head. True, they rather order \nme about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, \n\n\n\nLOOMINGS 5 \n\nlike a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this \nsort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one's \nsense of honour, particularly if you come of an old estab- \nlished family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or Ran- \ndolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if just \nprevious to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have \nbeen lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the \ntallest boys stand in awe of you. The transition is a \nkeen one, I assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, \nand requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics \nto enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears \noff hi time. \n\nWhat of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders \nme to get a broom and sweep down the decks ? What \ndoes that indignity amount to, weighed, I mean, in the \nscales of the New Testament ? Do you think the arch- \nangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I \npromptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that \nparticular instance ? Who ain/t a slave ? Tell me that. \nWell, then, however the~old^sea -captains may order me \nabout however they may thump and punch me about, \nI have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right ; \nthat everybody else is one way or other served in much the \nsame way either in a physical or metaphysical point of \nview, that is ; and so the universal thump is passed \nround, and all hands should rub each other's shoulder- \nblades, and be content. \n\nAgain, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make \na point of paying me for my trouble, whereas they never \npay passengers a single penny that I ever heard of. On \nthe contrary, passengers themselves must pay. And \nthere is all the difference in the world between paying \nand being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most \nuncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves \nentailed upon us. But being paid, what will compare \n\n\n\n6 MOBY-DICK \n\nwith it ? The urbane activity with which a man receives \nmoney is really marvellous, considering that we so \nearnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, \nand that on no account can a monied man enter heaven. \nAh ! how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition ! \n\nFinally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the \nwholesome exercise and pure air of the forecastle deck. \nFor as in this world, head-winds are far more prevalent \nthan winds from astern (that is, if you never violate \nthe Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the com- \nmodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at \nsecond hand from the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks \nhe breathes it first ; but not so. In much the same \nway do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other \nthings, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. \nBut wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt \nthe sea as a merchant sailor, I should now take it into \nmy head to go on a whaling voyage ; this the invisible \npolice-officer of the Fates, who has the constant surveil- \nlance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in \nsome unaccountable way he can better answer than any \none else. And, doubtless, my going on this whaling \nvoyage formed part of the grand programme of Provi- \ndence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in \nas a sort of brief interlude and solo between more exten- \nsive performances. I take it that this part of the bill \nmust have run something like this : \n\n' Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the \nUnited States. \n\n' WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. \n\n1 BLOODY BATTLE IN AFGHANISTAN.' \n\nThough I cannot tell why it was exactly that those \nstage managers, the Fates, put me down for this shabby \n\n\n\nLOOMINGS 7 \n\npart of a whaling voyage, when others were set down \nfor magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and easy \nparts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces \nthough I cannot tell why this was exactly ; yet, now that \nI recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little \ninto the springs and motives which, being cunningly \npresented to me under various disguises, induced me to \nset about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me \ninto the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my \nown unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment. \n\nChief among these motives was the overwhelming idea \nof the great whale himself. Such a gortentous and \nmysterious monster roused all my curiosity. Then the \nwild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk ; \nthe undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale ; these, \nwith all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian \nsights and sounds, helped to sway me to my wish. With \nother men, perhaps, such things would not have been \ninducements ; but as for me, I am tormented with an \neverlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail for- \nbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring \nwhat is good, I am quick to perceive a horror, and could \nstill be social with it would they let me since it is \nbut well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of \nthe place one lodges in. \n\nBy reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage \nwas welcome ; the great flood-gates of the wonder-world \nswung open, and in the wild conceits that swayed me to \nmy purpose, two and two there floated into my inmost \nsoul, endless processions of the whale, and, midmost of \nthem all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in \nthe air. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II \n\nTHE CARPET-BAG \n\nI stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked \nit under my arm, and started for Cape Horn and the \nPacific. Quitting the good city of old Manhatto, I duly \narrived in New Bedford. It was on a Saturday night in \nDecember. Much was I disappointed upon learning \nthat the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, \nand that no way of reaching that place would offer, till \nthe following Monday. \n\nAs most young candidates for the pains and penalties \nof whaling stop at this same New Bedford, thence to \nembark on their voyage, it may as well be related that I 5 \nfor one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was made \nup to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because \nthere was a fine, boisterous something about everything \nconnected with that famous old island, which amazingly \npleased me. Besides, though New Bedford has of late \nbeen gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and \nthough in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much \nbehind her, yet Nantucket was her great original the \nTyre of this Carthage ; the place where the first dead \nAmerican whale was stranded. Where else but from \nNantucket did those aboriginal whalemen, the Red Men, \nfirst sally out in canoes to give chase to the leviathan ? \nAnd where but from Nantucket, too, did that first adven- \nturous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported \ncobble-stones so goes the story to throw at the whales, \n\n\n\nTHE CARPET-BAG 9 \n\nin order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk \na harpoon from the bowsprit ? \n\nNow having a night, a day, and still another night \nfollowing before me in New Bedford, ere I could embark \nfor my destined port, it became a matter of concernment \nwhere I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a very \ndubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, \nbitingly cold and cheerless. I knew no one in the place. \nWith anxious grapnelsJE had sounded my pocket, and only \nbrought up a few pieces of silver. So, wherever you go, \nIshmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of a \ndreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the \ngloom toward the north with the darkness toward the \nsouth wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to \nlodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire \nthe price, and don't be too particular. \n\nWith halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the \nsign of 'The Crossed Harpoons ' but it looked too expen- \nsive and jolly there. Further on, from the bright red \nwindows of the ' Sword-Fish Inn,' there came such fer- \nvent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow \nand ice from before the house, for everywhere else the \ncongealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic \npavement, rather weary for me, when I struck my foot \nagainst the flinty projections, because from hard, remorse- \nless service the soles of mv boots were in a most miserable \n\nV \n\nplight. Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing \none moment to watch the broad glare in the street, and \nhear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within. But go i \non, Ishmael, said I at last ; don't you hear ? get away l \nfrom before the door ; your patched boots are stopping \nthe way. So on I went. I now by instinct followed the \nstreets that took me waterward, for there, doubtless, \nwere the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns. \n\nSuch dreary streets ! blocks of blackness, not houses, \n\n\n\n10 MOBY-DICK \n\non either hand, and here and there a candle, like a candle \nmoving about in a tomb. At this hour of the night, of \nthe last day of the week, that quarter of the town proved \nall but deserted. But presently I carne to a smoky \nlight proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of \nwhich stood invitingly open. It had a careless look, as \nif it were meant for the uses of the public ; so, entering, \nthe first thing I did was to stumble over an ash-box in \nthe porch. Ha ! thought I, ha, as the flying particles \nalmost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed \ncity, Gomorrah ? But ' The Cfossed Harpoons ' and \n4 The Sword-Fish ' ? this, then, must needs be the sign \nof ' The Trap. ' However, I picked myself up , and hearing \na loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second, \ninterior door. \n\nIt seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. \nA hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer ; \nand beyond, a black Angel of Doom was beating a book \nin a pulpit. It was a negro church ; and the preacher's \ntext was about the blackness of darkness, and the weep- \ning and wailing and teeth -gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, \nmuttered I, backing out, Wretched entertainment at the \nsign of ' The Trap ' ! \n\nMoving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far \nfrom the docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air ; \nand looking up, saw a swinging sign over the door with \na white painting upon it, faintly representing a tall straight \njet of misty spray, and these words underneath ' The \nSpouter-Inn : Peter Coffin.' \n\nCoffin ? Spouter ? Rather ominous in that particu- \nlar connection, thought I. But it is a common name in \nNantucket, they say, and I suppose this Peter here is an \nemigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and \nthe place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the \ndilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might \n\n\n\nTHE CARPET-BAG 11 \n\nhave been carted here from the ruins of some burnt dis- \ntrict, and as the swinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort \nof creak to it, I thought that here was the very spot for \ncheap lodgings, and the best of pea-coffee. \n\nIt was a queer sort of place a gable-ended old house, \none side palsied as it were, and leaning over sadly. It \nstood on a sharp bleak corner, where that tempestuous \nwind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it \ndid about poor Paul's tossed craft. Euroclydon, never- \ntheless, is a mighty pleasant zephyr to anyone indoors, \nwith his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed. 4 In \njudging of that tempestuous wind called Euroclydon,' \nsays an old writer of whose works I possess the only \ncopy extant ' it maketh a marvellous difference, \nwhether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where \nthe frost is all on the outside, or whether thou observest \nit from that Cashless window, where the frost is on both \nsides, and of which the wight Death is the only glazier.' \nTrue enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my \nmind old black-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes, these \neyes are windows, and this body of mine is the house. \nWhat a pity they didn't stop up the chinks and the \ncrannies though, and thrust in a little lint here and there. \nBut it 's too late to make any improvements now. The \nuniverse is finished ; the cope-stone is on, and the chips \nwere carted off a million years ago. Poor Lazarus there, \nchattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow, \nand shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he might \nplug up both ears with rags, and put a corn-cob into his \nmouth, and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous \nEuroclydon. Euroclydon ! says old Dives, in his red \nsilken wrapper (he had a redder one afterward) pooh, \npooh ! What a fine frosty night ; how Orion glitters ; \nwhat northern lights ! Let them talk of their oriental \nsummer climes of everlasting conservatories ; give me \n\n\n\n12 MOBY-DICK \n\nthe privilege of making my own summer with my own \ncoals. \n\nBut what thinks Lazarus ? Can he warm his blue \nhands by holding them up to the grand northern lights ? \nWould not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra than here ? \nWould he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along \nthe line of the equator ; yea, ye gods ! go down to the \nfiery pit itself, in order to keep out this frost ? \n\nNow, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the \ncurbstone before the door of Dives, this is more wonderful \nthan that an iceberg should be moored to one of the \nMoluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a Czar \nin an ice-palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president \nof a temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of \norphans. \n\nBut no more of this blubbering now, we are going a- \nwhaling, and there is plenty of that yet to come. Let \nus scrape the ice from our frosted feet, and see what sort \nof a place this ' Spouter ' may be. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III \n\nTHE SPOTTTER-INN \n\nENTERING that gable -ended Spouter-Inn, you found \nyourself in a wide, low, straggling entry with old-fashioned \nwainscots, reminding one of the bulwarks of some con- \ndemned old craft. On one side hung a very large oil- \npainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, \nthat in the unequal cross-lights by which you viewed it, \nit was only by diligent study and a series of systematic \nvisits to it, and careful inquiry of the neighbours, that \nyou could any way arrive at an understanding of its \npurpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades and \nshadows, that at first you almost thought some ambitious \nyoung artist, in the time of the New England hags, had \nendeavoured to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint \nof much and earnest contemplation, and oft-repeated \nponderings, and especially by throwing open the little \nwindow toward the back of the entry, you at last come \nto the conclusion that such an idea, however wild, might \nnot be altogether unwarranted. \n\nBut what most puzzled and confounded you was a \nlong, limber, portentous, black mass of something hover- \ning in the centre of the picture over three blue, dim, \nperpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast. A boggy, \nsoggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive a nervous \nman distracted. Yet there was a sort of indefinite, half- \nattained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly \nfroze you to it, till you in voluntarily, took an oath with \nyourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant. \n\nis \n\n\n\n14 MOBY-DICK \n\nEver and anon a bright, but, alas, deceptive idea would \ndart you through. It 's the Black Sea in a midnight gale. \nIt 's the unnatural combat of the four primal elements. \nIt 's a blasted heath. It 's a Hyperborean winter scene. \nIt 's the breaking-up of the ice-bound stream of Time. \nBut at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous \nsomething in the picture's midst. That once found out, \nand all the rest were plain. But stop ; does it not bear \na faint resemblance to a gigantic fish ? even the great \nleviathan himself ? \n\nIn fact, the artist's design seemed this : a final theory \nof my own, partly based upon the aggregated opinions \nof many aged persons with whom I conversed upon the \nsubject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner in a great \nhurricane ; the half-foundered ship weltering there with \nits three dismantled masts alone visible ; and an exasper- \nated whale, purposing to spring clean over the craft, is \nin the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three \nmast-heads. \n\nThe opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with \na heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears. Some \nwere thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory \nsaws ; others were tufted with knots of human hair ; and \none was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping round \nlike the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long- \narmed mower. You shuddered as you gazed, and \nwondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could \never have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking, \nhorrifying implement. Mixed with these were rusty \nold whaling-lances and harpoons all broken and deformed. \nSome were storied weapons. With this once long lance, \nnow wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan Swain \nkill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And \nthat harpoon so like a corkscrew now was flung in \nJavan seas, and run away with by a whale, years after- \n\n\n\nTHE SPOUTER-INN 15 \n\nward slain off the Cape of Blanco. The original iron \nentered nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle sojourning \nin the body of a man, travelled full forty feet, and at last \nwas found imbedded in the hump. \n\nCrossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low- \narched way cut through what in old times must have \nbeen a great central chimney with fire-places all round \nyou enter the public room. A still duskier place is this, \nwith such low ponderous beams above, and such old \nwrinkled planks beneath, that you would almost fancy \nyou trod some old craft's cockpits, especially of such a \nhowling night, when this corner-anchored old ark rocked \nso furiously. On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like \ntable covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty \nrarities gathered from this wide world's remotest nooks. \nProjecting from the further angle of the room stands a \ndark-looking den the bar a rude attempt at a right \nwhale's head. Be that how it may, there stands the vast \narched bone of the whale's jaw, so wide, a coach might \nalmost drive beneath it. Within are shabby shelves, \nranged round with old decanters, bottles, flasks ; and in \nthose jaws of swift destruction, like another cursed Jonah \n(by which name indeed they called him), bustles a little \nwithered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells the \nsailors deliriums and death. \n\nAbominable are the tumblers into which he pours his \npoison. Though true cylinders without within, the \nvillainous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered down- \nward to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians rudely \npecked into the glass, surround these footpads' goblets. \nFill to this mark, and your charge is but a penny ; to this \na penny more ; and so on to the full glass the Cape \nHorn measure, which you may gulp down for a shilling. \nUpon entering the place I found a number of young \nseamen gathered about a table, examining by a dim light \n\n\n\n16 MOBY-DICK \n\ndivers speiimens of skrimshander. I sought the land- \nlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with \na room, received for answer that his house was full not \na bed unoccupied. ' But avast, 5 he added, tapping his \nforehead, ' you hain't no objections to sharin* a har- \npooneer 's blanket, have ye ? I s'pose you are goin' a- \nwhalin 5 , so you 'd better get used to that sort of thing. 5 \n\nI told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed ; that \nif I should ever do so, it would depend upon who the \nharpooneer might be, and that if he (the landlord) really \nhad no other place for me, and the harpooneer was not \ndecidedly objectionable, why, rather than wander further \nabout a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put \nup with the half of any decent man 5 s blanket. \n\n' I thought so. All right ; take a seat. Supper ? \nyou want supper ? Supper 5 11 be ready directly. 5 \n\nI sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like \na bench on the Battery. At one end a ruminating tar \nwas still further adorning it with his jack-knife, stooping \nover and diligently working away at the space between \nhis legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, \nbut he didn't make much headway, I thought. \n\nAt last some four or five of us were summoned to our \nmeal in an adjoining room. It was cold as Iceland \nno fire at all the landlord said he couldn't afford it. \nNothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a winding \nsheet. We were fain to button up our monkey-jackets, \nand hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half- \nfrozen fingers. But the fare was of the most substantial \nkind not only meat and potatoes, but dumplings ; good \nheavens ! dumplings for supper ! One young fellow in \na green box-coat addressed himself to these dumplings \nhi a most direful manner. \n\n' My boy,' said the landlord, ' you '11 have the night- \nmare to a dead sartainty.' \n\n\n\nTHE SPOUTER-INN 17 \n\n'Landlord,' I whispered, w that ain't the harpooneer, \nis it ? ' \n\n1 Oh, no/ said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, \n4 the harpooneer is a dark - complexioned chap. He \nnever eats dumplings, he don't he eats nothing but \nsteaks, and likes 'em rare.' \n\n' The devil he does, ' says I. ' Where is that harpooneer ? \nIs he here ? ' \n\n' He '11 be here afore long,' was the answer. \n\nI could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of \nthis ' dark-complexioned ' harpooneer. At any rate, I \nmade up my mind that if it so turned out that we should \nsleep together, he must undress and get into bed before \nI did. \n\nSupper over, the company went back to the bar-room, \nwhen, knowing not what else to do with myself, I resolved \nto spend the rest of the evening as a looker-on. \n\nPresently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting \nup, the landlord cried, ' That 's the Grampus's crew. I \nseed her reported in the offing this morning ; a three \nyears' voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah, boys ; now we '11 \nhave the latest news from the Feegees.' \n\nA tramping of sea-boots was heard in the entry ; the \ndoor was flung open, and in rolled a wild set of mariners \nenough. Enveloped in their shaggy watch-coats, and \nwith their heads muffled in woollen comforters, all be- \ndarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, \nthey seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador. They \nhad just landed from their boat, and this was the first \nhouse they entered. No wonder, then, that they made \na straight wake for the whale's mouth the bar when \nthe wrinkled little old Jonah, there officiating, soon \npoured them out brimmers all round. One complained \nof a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed \nhim a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he \n\nVOL. I. B \n\n\n\n18 MOBY-DICK \n\nswore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs \nwhatsoever, never mind of how long standing, or whether \ncaught off the coast of Labrador, or on the weather-side \nof an ice -island. \n\nThe liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it \ngenerally does even with the arrantest topers newly \nlanded from sea, and they began capering about most \nobstreperously. \n\nI observed, however, that one of them held somewhat \naloof, and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the \nhilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face, yet upon \nthe whole he refrained from making as much noise as the \nrest. This man interested me at once ; and since the sea- \ngods had ordained that he should soon become my ship- \nmate (though but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this \nnarrative is concerned), I will here venture upon a little \ndescription of him. He stood full six feet in height, with \nnoble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I have \nseldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply \nbrown and burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the \ncontrast ; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated \nsome reminiscences that did not seem to give him much \njoy. His voice at once announced that he was a \nSoutherner, and from his fine stature, I thought he must \nbe one of those tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian \nRidge in Virginia. When the revelry of his companions \nhad mounted to its height, this man slipped away unob- \nserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my \ncomrade on the sea. In a few minutes, however, he was \nmissed by his shipmates, and being, it seems, for some \nreason a huge favourite with them, they raised a cry of \n' Bulkington ! Bulkington ! where 5 s Bulkington ? ' and \ndarted out of the house in pursuit of him. \n\nIt was now about nine o'clock, and the room seeming \nalmost supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began \n\n\n\nTHE SPOUTER-INN 19 \n\nto congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred \nto me just previous to the entrance of the seamen. \n\nNo man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you \nwould a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother. \nI don't know how it is, but people like to be private when \nthey are sleeping. And when it comes to sleeping with \nan unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town, \nand that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections \nindefinitely multiply. Nor was there any earthly reason \nwhy I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed, more than \nanybody else ; for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at \nsea, than bachelor kings do ashore. To be sure, they \nall sleep together in one apartment, but you have your \nown hammock, and cover yourself with your own blanket, \nand sleep in your own skin. \n\nThe more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I \nabominated the thought of sleeping with him. It was \nfair to presume that being a harpooneer, his linen or \nwoollen, as the case might be, would not be of the tidiest, \ncertainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over. \nBesides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer \nought to be home and going bedward. Suppose now, \nhe should tumble in upon me at midnight how could I \ntell from what vile hole he had been coming ? \n\n' Landlord ! I Ve changed my mind about that \nharpooneer. I shan't sleep with him. I '11 try the bench \nhere.' \n\n' Just as you please ; I 'm sorry I can't spare ye a \ntablecloth for a mattress, and it 's a plaguy rough board \nhere ' feeling of the knots and notches. ' But wait \na bit, Skrimshander ; I Ve got a carpenter's plane there \nin the bar wait, I say, and I '11 make ye snug enough.' \nSo saying he procured the plane ; and with his old silk \nhandkerchief first dusting the bench, vigorously set to \nplaning away at my bed, the while grinning like an ape. \n\n\n\n20 MOBY-DICK \n\nThe shavings flew right and left ; till at last the plane- \niron came bump against an indestructible knot. The \nlandlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for \nheaven's sake to quit the bed was soft enough to suit \nme, and I did not know how all the planing in the world \ncould make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering \nup the shavings with another grin, and throwing them \ninto the great stove in the middle of the room, he went \nabout his business, and left me in a brown study. \n\nI now took the measure of the bench, and found that \nit was a foot too short ; but that could be mended with \na chair. But it was a foot too narrow, and the other \nbench in the room was about four inches higher than the \nplaned one so there was no yoking them. I then placed \nthe first bench lengthwise along the only clear space \nagainst the wall, leaving a little interval between, for my \nback to settle down in. But I soon found that there \ncame such a draught of cold air over me from under the \nsill of the window, that this plan would never do at all, \nespecially as another current from the rickety door met \nthe one from the window, and both together formed a \nseries of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the \nspot where I had thought to spend the night. \n\nThe devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, \ncouldn't I steal a march on him bolt his door inside, and \njump into his bed, not to be wakened by the most violent \nknockings ? It seemed no bad idea ; but upon second \nthoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what \nthe next morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, \nthe harpooneer might be standing in the entry, all ready \nto knock me down ! \n\nStill, looking round me again, and seeing no possible \nchance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other \nperson's bed, I began to think that after all I might be \ncherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown \n\n\n\nTHE SPOQTER-INN 21 \n\nharpooneer. Thinks I, I '11 wait awhile ; he must be \ndropping in before long. 1 11 have a good look at him \nthen, and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows \nafter all there 's no telling. \n\nBut though the other boarders kept coming in by \nones, twos, and threes, and going to bed, yet no sign of \nmy harpooneer. \n\n4 Landlord ! ' said I, ' what sort of a chap is he does \nhe always keep such late hours ? ' It was now hard \nupon twelve o'clock. \n\nThe landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, \nand seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond \nmy comprehension. ' No,' he answered, ' generally he 5 s \nan early bird airley to bed and airley to rise yes, he 's \nthe bird what catches the worm. But to-night he \nwent out a-peddling, you see, and I don't see what \non airth keeps him so late, unless, maybe, he can't sell \nhis head.' \n\n' Can't sell his head ? What sort of a bamboozingly \nstory is this you are telling me ? ' getting into a tower- \ning rage. ' Do you pretend to say, landlord, that this \nharpooneer is actually engaged this blessed Saturday \nnight, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head \naround this town ? ' \n\n' That 's precisely it,' said the landlord, ' and I told \nhim he couldn't sell it here, the market 's overstocked.' \n\n' With what ? ' shouted I. \n\n' With heads, to be sure ; ain't there too many heads \nin the world ? ' \n\n' I tell you what it is, landlord,' said I, quite calmly, \n' you 'd better stop spinning that yarn to me I 'm not \ngreen.' \n\n6 Maybe not, ' taking out a stick and whittling a tooth- \npick, ' but I rayther guess you '11 be done brown if that \n'ere harpooneer hears you a-slanderin' his head.' \n\n\n\n22 MOBY-DICK \n\n' I '11 break it for him/ said I, now flying into a passion \nagain at this unaccountable farrago of the landlord's. \n\n' It 's broke a 'ready,' said he. \n\n' Broke/ said I ' broke, do you mean ? ' \n\n' Sartain, and that 's the very reason he can't sell it, \nI guess.' \n\n' Landlord/ said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. \nHecla in a snow-storm, 'landlord, stop whittling. You \nand I must understand one another, and that too without \ndelay. I come to your house and want a bed ; you tell \nme you can only give me half a one ; that the other half \nbelongs to a certain harpooneer. And about this har- \npooneer, whom I have not yet seen, you persist in telling \nme the most mystifying and exasperating stories, tending \nto beget in me an uncomfortable feeling toward the man \nwhom you design for my bedfellow* a sort of connection, \nlandlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the \nhighest degree. I now demand of you to speak out and \ntell me who and what this harpooneer is, and whether I \nshall be in all respects safe to spend the night with him. \nAnd in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay that \nstory about selling his head, which if true I take to be \ngood evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I 've \nno idea of sleeping with a madman ; and you, sir, you \nI mean, landlord, you, sir, by trying to induce me to do \nso knowingly, would thereby render yourself liable to a \ncriminal prosecution.' \n\n' Wall/ said the landlord, fetching a long breath, 'that 's \na purty long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and \nthen. But be easy, be easy, this here harpooneer I have \nbeen tellin' you of has just arrived from the South Seas, \nwhere he bought up a lot of 'balmed New Zealand heads \n(great curios, you know), and he 's sold all on 'em but \none, and that one he 's tryin' to sell to-night, cause to- \nmorrow 's Sunday, and it would not do to be sellin' \n\n\n\nTHE SPOUTER-INN 23 \n\nhuman heads about the streets when folks is goin' to \nchurches. He wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him \njust as he was goin' out of the door with four heads strung \non a string, for all the airth like a string of inions.' \n\nThis account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable \nmystery, and showed that the landlord, after all, had had \nno idea of fooling me but at the same time what could \nI think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a Saturday \nnight clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a \ncannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolaters ? \n\n' Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a danger- \nous man.' \n\n' He pays reg'lar, 5 was the rejoinder. ' But come, \nit 's getting dreadful late, you had better be turning \nflukes it 's a nice bed : Sail and me slept in that 'ere \nbed the night we were spliced. There 's plenty room for \ntwo to kick about in that bed ; it 's an almighty big bed \nthat. Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam \nand little Johnny in the foot of it. But I got a-dreaming \nand sprawling about one night, and somehow, Sam got \npitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm. \nArter that, Sal said it wouldn't do. Come along here, \nI '11 give ye a glim in a jiffy ' ; and so saying he lighted a \ncandle and held it toward me, offering to lead the way. \nBut I stood irresolute ; when looking at a clock in the \ncorner, he exclaimed, ' I vum it 's Sunday you won't \nsee that harpooneer to-night ; he 's come to anchor some- \nwhere come along then ; do come ; won't ye come ? ' \n\nI considered the matter a moment, and then upstairs \nwe went, and I was ushered into a small room, cold as a \nclam, and furnished, sure enough, with a prodigious bed, \nalmost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to \nsleep abreast. \n\n' There,' said the landlord, placing the candle on a \ncrazy old sea-chest that did double duty as a wash-stand \n\n\n\n24 MOBY-DICK \n\nand centre table ; ' there, make yourself comfortable \nnow, and good night to ye.' I turned round from eyeing \nthe bed, but he had disappeared. \n\nFolding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. \nThough none of the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny \ntolerably well. I then glanced round the room ; and \nbesides the bedstead and centre table, could see no other \nfurniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the four \nwalls, and a papered fire-board representing a man striking \na whale. Of things not properly belonging to the room, \nthere was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the \nfloor in one corner ; also a large seaman's bag, containing \nthe harpooneer's wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk. \nLikewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish-hooks \non the shelf over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon stand- \ning at the head of the bed. \n\nBut what is this on the chest ? I took it up, and held \nit close to the light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried \nevery way possible to arrive at some satisfactory con- \nclusion concerning it. I can compare it to nothing but \na large door-mat, ornamented at the edges with little \ntinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills \nround an Indian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in \nthe middle of this mat, as you see the same in South \nAmerican ponchos. But could it be possible that any \nsober harpooneer would get into a door-mat, and parade \nthe streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise ? \nI put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, \nbeing uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a \nlittle damp, as though this mysterious harpooneer had \nbeen wearing it of a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit \nof glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a \nsight in my life. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry \nthat I gave myself a kink in the neck. \n\nI sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced \n\n\n\nTHE SPOUTER-INN 25 \n\nthinking about this head-peddling harpooneer, and his \ndoor-mat. After thinking some time on the bedside, I \ngot up and took off my monkey-jacket, and then stood \nin the middle of the room thinking. I then took off my \ncoat, and thought a little more in my shirt -sleeves. But \nbeginning to feel very cold now, half undressed as I was, \nand remembering what the landlord said about the har- \npooneer 's not coming home at all that night, it being so \nvery late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my \npantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light \ntumbled into bed, and commended myself to the care of \nheaven. \n\nWhether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or \nbroken crockery, there is no telling, but I rolled about a \ngood deal, and could not sleep for a long time. At last \nI slid off into a light doze, and had pretty nearly made a \ngood offing toward the land of Nod, when I heard a \nheavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light \ncome into the room from under the door. \n\nLord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, \nthe infemal head-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and \nresolved not to say a word till spoken to. Holding a \nlight in one hand, and that identical New Zealand head \nin the other, the stranger entered the room, and without \nlooking toward the bed, placed his candle a good way \noff from me on the floor in one corner, and then began \nworking away at the knotted cords of the large bag I \nbefore spoke of as being in the room. I was all eagerness \nto see his face, but he kept it averted for some time while \nemployed in unlacing the bag 's mouth . This accomplished, \nhowever, he turned round when, good heavens ! what a \nsight ! Such a face ! It was of a dark, purplish, yellow \ncolour, here and there stuck over with large, blackish- \nlooking squares. Yes, it 's just as I thought, he 's a \nterrible bedfellow ; he 's been in a fight, got dreadfully \n\n\n\n26 MOBY-DICK \n\ncut, and here he is, just from the surgeon. But at that \nmoment he chanced to turn his face so toward the light, \nthat I plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at \nall, those black squares on his cheeks. They were stains \nof some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make \nof this ; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. \nI remembered a story of a white man a whaleman too \nwho, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by \nthem. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of \nhis distant voyages, must have met with a similar adven- \nture. And what is it, thought I, after all ! It 's only \nhis outside ; a man can be honest in any sort of skin. \nBut then, what to make of his unearthly complexion, \nthat part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely \nindependent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it \nmight be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning ; \nbut I never heard of a hot sun's tanning a white man into \na purplish-yellow one. However, I had never been in \nthe South Seas ; and perhaps the sun there produced \nthese extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while \nall these ideas were passing through me like lightning, \nthis harpooneer never noticed me at all. But, after some \ndifficulty having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling \nin it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and \na sealskin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the \nold chest in the middle of the room, he then took the New \nZealand head a ghastly thing enough and crammed it \ndown into the bag. He now took off his hat a new \nbeaver hat when I came nigh singing out with fresh \nsurprise. There was no hair on his head none to speak \nof, at least nothing but a small scalp -knot twisted up on \nhis forehead. His bald purplish head now looked for \nall the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the^stranger \nstood between me and the door, I would have bolted out \nof it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner. \n\n\n\nTHE SPOUTER-INN 27 \n\nEven as it was, I thought something of slipping out \nof the window, but it was the second floor back. I am \nno coward, but what to make of this head-peddling purple \nrascal altogether passed my comprehension. Ignorance, \njs^the parent^QJJear, and being completely nonplussed \nand confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now \nas much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who \nhad thus broken into my room at the dead of night. In \nfact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough \njust then to address him, and demand a satisfactory \nanswer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him. \n\nMeanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, \nand at last showed his chest and arms. As I live, these \ncovered parts of him were checkered with the same \nsquares as his face ; his back, too, was all over the same \ndark squares ; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years' \nWar, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. \nStill more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of \ndark green frogs were running up the trunks of young \npalms. It was now quite plain that he must be some \nabominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whale- \nman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian \ncountry. I quaked to think of it. A peddler of heads too \nperhaps the heads of his own brothers. He might take \na fancy to mine heavens ! look at that tomahawk ! \n\nBut there was no time for shuddering, for now the \nsavage went about something that completely fascinated \nmy attention, and convinced me that he must indeed be \na heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or \ndreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, \nhe fumbled in the pockets, and produced at length a \ncurious little deformed image with a hunch on its back, \nand exactly the colour of a three-days-old Congo baby. \nRemembering the embalmed head, at first I almost \nthought that this black manikin was a real baby pre- \n\n\n\n28 MOBY-DICK \n\nserved in some similar manner. But seeing that it was \nnot at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal like \npolished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but \na wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now \nthe savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing \nthe papered fire -board, sets up this little hunchbacked \nimage, like a ten-pin, between the andirons. The chimney \njambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty, so that \nI thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little \nshrine or chapel for his Congo idol. \n\nI now screwed my eyes hard toward the half-hidden \nimage, feeling but ill at ease meantime to see what was \nnext to follow. First he takes about a double handful \nof shavings out of his grego pocket, and places them \ncarefully before the idol ; then laying a bit of ship -biscuit \non top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled \n<the shavings into a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after \nmany hasty snatches into the fire, and still hastier with- \ndrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed to be scorching \nthem badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the \nbiscuit ; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, \nhe made a polite offer of it to the little negro. But the \nlittle devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at \nall ; he never moved his lips. All these strange antics \nwere accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from \nthe devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song \nor else singing some pagan psalmody or other, during \nwhich his face twitched about in the most unnatural \nmanner. At last, extinguishing the fire, he took the idol \nup very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his \ngrego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman \nbagging a dead woodcock. \n\nAll these queer proceedings increased my uncomf ortable- \nness, and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of \nconcluding his business operations, and jumping into bed \n\n\n\nTHE SPOUTER-INN 29 \n\nwith me, I thought it was high time, now or never, before \nthe light was put out, to break the spell in which I had \nso long been bound. \n\nBut the interval I spent in deliberating what to say \nwas a fatal one. Taking up his tomahawk from the table, \nhe examined the head of it for an instant, and then hold- \ning it to the light, with his mouth at the handle, he puffed \nout great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment \nthe light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, toma- \nhawk between his teeth, sprang into bed with me. I \nsang out, I could not help it now ; and giving a sudden \ngrunt of astonishment he began feeling me. \n\nStammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled \naway from him against the wall, and then conjured him, \nwhoever or whatever he might be, to keep quiet, and let \nme get up and light the lamp again. But his guttural \nresponses satisfied me at once that he but ill compre- \nhended my meaning. \n\n' Who-e debel you ? ' he at last said ' you no speak-e, \ndam-me, I kill-e.' And so saying the lighted tomahawk \nbegan flourishing about me in the dark. \n\n4 Landlord, for God's sake, Peter Coffin ! ' shouted I. \n' Landlord ! Watch ! Coffin ! Angels ! save me ! ' \n\n1 Speak-e ! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e ! ' \nagain growled the cannibal, while his horrid flourishings \nof the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about \nme till I thought my linen would get on fire. But thank \nheaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room \nlight in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him. \n\n4 Don't be afraid now,' said he, grinning again. ' Quee- \nqueg here wouldn't harm a hair of your head.' \n\n' Stop your grinning,' shouted I, ' and why didn't you \ntell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal ? ' \n\n' I thought ye know'd it ; didn't I tell ye, he was \na-peddlin' heads around town ? but turn flukes again \n\n\n\n30 MOBY-DICK \n\nand go to sleep. Queequeg, look here you sabbee me, \nI sabbee you this man sleepe you you sabbee ? ' \n\n' Me sabbee plenty,' grunted Queequeg, puffing away \nat his pipe and sitting up in bed. \n\n' You gettee in/ he added, motioning to me with his \ntomahawk, and throwing the clothes to one side. He \nreally did this in not only a civil but a really kind and \ncharitable way. I stood looking at him a moment. For \nall his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely- \nlooking cannibal. What 's all this fuss I have been \nmaking about, thought I to myself the man ? s a human \nbeing just as I am : he has just as much reason to fear \nme, as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep with a \nsober cannibal than a drunken Christian. \n\n'Landlord,' said I, 'tell him to stash his tomahawk \nthere, or pipe, or whatever you call it ; tell him to stop \nsmoking, in short, and I will turn in with him. But I \ndon't fancy having a man smoking in bed with me. It 's \ndangerous. Besides, I ain't insured.' \n\nThis being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and \nagain politely motioned me to get into bed rolling over \nto one side as much as to say, I won't touch a leg of ye. \n\n' Good night, landlord,' said I, ' you may go.' \n\nI turned in, and never slept better in my life. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV \n\nTHE COUNTERPANE \n\nUPON waking next morning about daylight, I found \nQueequeg's arm thrown over me in the most loving and \naffectionate manner. You had almost thought I had \nbeen his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full \nof odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles ; and \nthis arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable \nCretan labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were \nof one precise shade owing, I suppose, to his keeping \nhis arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his \nshirt-sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times \nthis same arm of his, I say, looked for all the world like \na strip of that same patchwork quilt. Indeed, partly \nlying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I could \nhardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues \ntogether ; and it was only by the sense of weight and \npressure that I could tell that Queequeg was hugging me. \nMy sensations were strange. Let me try to explain \nthem. When I was a child, I well remember a somewhat \nsimilar circumstance that befell me ; whether it was a \nreality or a dream, I never could entirely settle. The \ncircumstance was this. I had been cutting up some \ncaper or other I think it was trying to crawl up the \nchimney, as I had seen a little sweep do a few days \nprevious ; and my stepmother, who, somehow or other, \nwas all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed \nsupperless, my mother dragged me by the legs out \nof the chimney and packed me off to bed, though it was \nonly two o'clock in the afternoon of the 21st June, the \n\n31 \n\n\n\n32 MOBY-DICK \n\nlongest day in the year in our hemisphere. 1 felt dread- \nfully. But there was no help for it, so upstairs I went \nto my little room in the third floor, undressed myself as \nslowly as possible so as to kill time, and with a bitter \nsigh got between the sheets. \n\nI lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire \nhours must elapse before I could hope for a resurrection. \nSixteen hours in bed ! the small of my back ached to \nthink of it. And it was so light too ; the sun shining \nin at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the \nstreets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house. \nI felt worse and worse at last I got up, dressed, and \nsoftly going down in my stockinged feet, sought out my \nstepmother, and suddenly threw myself at her feet, be- \nseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good \nslippering for my misbehaviour ; anything indeed but con- \ndemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of \ntime. But she was the best and most conscientious of \nstepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For \nseveral hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great \ndeal worse than I have ever done since, even from the \ngreatest subsequent misfortunes. At last I must have \nfallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze ; and slowly \nwaking from it half steeped in dreams I opened my \neyes, and the before sunlit room was now wrapped in \nouter darkness. Instantly I felt a shock running through \nall my frame ; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was \nto be heard ; but a supernatural hand seemed placed \nin mine. My arm hung over the counterpane, and the \nnameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom, to which \nthe hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my bedside. \nFor what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen \nwith the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my \nhand ; yet ever thinking that if I could but stir it one \nsingle inch, the horrid spell would be broken. I knew \n\n\n\nTHE COUNTERPANE 33 \n\nnot how this consciousness at last glided away from me ; \nbut waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered \nit all, and for days and weeks and months afterward I \nlost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery. \nNay, to this very hour, I often puzzle myself with it. \n\nNow, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at \nfeeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar, \nin their strangeness, to those which I experienced on \nwaking up and seeing Queequeg 's pagan arm thrown \nround me. But at length all the past night's events \nsoberly recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I \nlay only alive to the comical predicament. For though \nI tried to move his arm unlock his bridegroom clasp \nyet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly, as \nthough naught but death should part us twain. I now \nstrove to rouse him * Queequeg ! ' but his only answer \nwas a snore. I then rolled over, my neck feeling as if \nit were in a horse-collar ; and suddenly felt a slight \nscratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the \ntomahawk sleeping by the savage's side, as if it were a \nhatchet -faced baby. A pretty pickle, truly, thought I ; \nabed here in a strange house in the broad day, with a \ncannibal and a tomahawk ! ' Queequeg ! in the name \nof goodness, Queequeg, wake ! ' At length, by dint of \nmuch wriggling, and loud and incessant expostulations \nupon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow-male in \nthat matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in extracting \na grunt ; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook \nhimself all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the \nwater, and sat up in bed, stiff as a pikestaff, looking at \nme, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether re- \nmember how I came to be there, though a dim conscious- \nness of knowing something about me seemed slowly \ndawning over him. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, \nhaving no serious misgivings now, and bent upon narrowly \n\nVOL. i. c \n\n\n\n34 MOBY-DICK \n\nobserving so curious a creature. When, at last, his mind \nseemed made up touching the character of his bed- \nfellow, and he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact, \nhe jumped out upon the floor, and by certain signs and \nsounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he \nwould dress first and then leave me to dress afterward, \nleaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I, \nQueequeg, under the circumstances, this is a very civilised \noverture ; but, the truth is, these savages have an innate \nsense of delicacy, say what you will ; it is marvellous how \nessentially polite they are. I pay this particular compli- \nment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much \ncivility and consideration, while I was guilty of great \nrudeness ; staring at him from the bed, and watching all \nhis toilet motions ; for the time my curiosity getting the \nbetter of my breeding. Nevertheless, a man like Quee- \nqueg you don't see every day, he and his ways were well \nworth unusual regarding. \n\nHe commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver \nhat, a very tall one, by the by, and then still minus his \ntrowsers he hunted up his boots. What under the \nheavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his next movement \nwas to crush himself boots in hand, and hat on under \nthe bed ; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strain- \nings, I inferred he was hard at work booting himself ; \nthough by no law of propriety that I ever heard of is \nany man required to be private when putting on his boots. \nBut Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transi- \ntion state neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was \njust enough civilised to show off his outlandishness in the \nstrangest possible manner. His education was not yet \ncompleted. He was an undergraduate. If he had not \nbeen a small degree civilised, he very probably would \nnot have troubled himself with boots at all ; but then, \nif he had not been still a savage, he never would have \n\n\n\nTHE COUNTERPANE 35 \n\ndreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At \nlast, he emerged with his hat very much dented and \ncrushed down over his eyes, and began creaking and \nlimping about the room, as if, not being much accustomed \nto boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones pro- \nbably not made to order either rather pinched and \ntormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning. \n\nSeeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, \nand that the street being very narrow, the house opposite \ncommanded a plain view into the room, and observing \nmore and more the indecorous figure that Queequeg \nmade, staving about with little else but his hat and boots \non, I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his \ntoilet somewhat, and particularly to get into his panta- \nloons as soon as possible. He complied, and then pro- \nceeded to wash himself. At that time in the morning \nany Christian would have washed his face ; but Queequeg, \nto my amazement, contented himself with restricting \nhis ablutions to his chest, arms, and hands. He then \ndonned his waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap \non the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water and \ncommenced lathering his face. I was watching to see \nwhere he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he takes the \nharpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long wooden \nstock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, \nand striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, \nbegins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his \ncheeks. Thinks I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers's best \ncutlery with a vengeance. Afterward I wondered the \nless at this operation when I came to know of what \nfine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how \nexceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept. \n\nThe rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly \nmarched out of the room, wrapped up in his great pilot \nmonkey-jacket, and sporting his harpoon like a marshal's \nbaton. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V \n\nBREAKFAST \n\nI QUICKLY followed suit, and descending into the bar-room \naccosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly. I \ncherished no malice toward him, though he had been \nskylarking with me not a little in the matter of my \nbedfellow. \n\nHowever, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and \nrather too scarce a good thing ; the more 's the pity. So, \nif any one man, in his own proper person, afford stuff for \na good joke to anybody, let him not be backward, but let \nhim cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in \nthat way. And the man that has anything bountifully \nlaughable about him, be sure there is more in that man \nthan you perhaps think for. \n\nThe bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been \ndropping in the night previous, and whom I had not as \nyet had a good look at. They were nearly all whalemen ; \nchief mates, and second mates, and third mates, and sea- \ncarpenters, and sea-coopers, and sea-blacksmiths, and \nharpooneers, and ship-keepers ; a brown and brawny \ncompany, with bosky beards ; an unshorn, shaggy set, \nall wearing monkey-jackets for morning gowns. \n\nYou could pretty plainly tell how long each one had \nbeen ashore. This young fellow's healthy cheek is like \na sun-toasted pear in hue, and would seem to smell \nalmost as musky ; he cannot have been three days landed \nfrom his Indian voyage. That man next him looks a \nfew shades lighter ; you might say a touch of satinwood \n\n36 \n\n\n\nBREAKFAST 37 \n\nis in him. In the complexion of a third still lingers a \ntropic tawn, but slightly bleached withal ; lie doubtless \nhas tarried whole weeks ashore. But who could show a \ncheek like Queequeg ? which, barred with various tints, \nseemed like the Andes' western slope, to show forth in \none array, contrasting climates, zone by zone. \n\n' Grub, ho ! ' now cried the landlord, flinging open a \ndoor, and in we went to breakfast. \n\nThey say that men who have seen the world, thereby \nbecome quite at ease in manner, quite self-possessed in \ncompany. Not always, though : Ledyard, the great New \nEngland traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch one ; of \nall men, they possessed the least assurance in the parlour. \nBut perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge \ndrawn by dogs as Ledyard did, or the taking a long solitary \nwalk on an empty stomach, in the negro heart of Africa, \nwhich was the sum of poor Mungo 's performances this \nkind of travel, I say, may not be the very best mode of \nattaining a high social polish. Still, for the most part, \nthat sort of thing is to be had anywhere. \n\nThese reflections just here are occasioned by the cir- \ncumstance that after we were all seated at the table, and \nI was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling ; \nto my no small surprise nearly every man maintained a \nprofound silence. And not only that, but they looked \nembarrassed. Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of \nwhom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded \ngreat whales on the high seas entire strangers to them \nand duelled them dead without winking ; and yet, here \nthey sat at a social breakfast table all of the same calling, \nall of kindred tastes looking round as sheepishly at \neach other as though they had never been out of sight \nof some sheepfold among the Green Mountains. A \ncurious sight ; these bashful bears, these timid warrior \nwhalemen ! \n\n\n\n38 MOBY-DICK \n\nBut as for Queequeg why, Queequeg sat there among \nthem at the head of the table, too, it so chanced as \ncool as an icicle. To be sure, I cannot say much for his \nbreeding. His greatest admirer could not have cordially \njustified his bringing his harpoon in to breakfast with him, \nand using it there without ceremony ; reaching over the \ntable with it, to the imminent jeopardy of many heads, \nand grappling the beefsteaks toward him. But that \nwas certainly very coolly done by him, and everyone \nknows that in most people's estimation, to do anything \ncoolly is to do it genteelly. \n\nWe will not speak of all Queequeg's peculiarities here ; \nhow he eschewed coffee and hot rolls, and applied his \nundivided attention to beefsteaks, done rare. Enough, \nthat when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest \ninto the public room, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was \nsitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his \ninseparable hat on, when I sallied out for a stroll. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI \n\nTHE STREET \n\nIF I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so \noutlandish an individual as Queequeg circulating among \nthe polite society of a civilised town, that astonishment \nsoon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through \nthe streets of New Bedford. \n\nIn thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable sea- \nport will frequently offer to view the queerest -looking \nnondescripts from foreign parts. Even in Broadway \nand Chestnut Streets, Mediterranean mariners will some- \ntimes jostle the affrighted ladies. Regent Street is not \nunknown to Lascars and Malays ; and at Bombay, in the \nApollo Green, live Yankees have often scared the natives. \nBut New Bedford beats all Water Street and Wapping. \nIn these last -mentioned haunts you see only sailors ; but \nin New Bedford actual cannibals stand chatting at street \ncorners ; savages outright ; many of whom yet carry on \ntheir bones unholy flesh. It makes a stranger stare. \n\nBut, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatabooarrs, Erro- \nmanggoans, Pannangians, and Brighggians, and besides \nthe wild specimens of the whaling -craft which unheeded \nreel about the streets, you will see other sights still more \ncurious, certainly more comical. There weekly arrive \nin this town scores of green Vermonters and New Hamp- \nshire men, all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery. \nThey are mostly young, of stalwart frames ; fellows who \nhave felled forests, and now seek to drop the axe and \nsnatch the whale-lance. Many are as green as the Green \n\n\n\n40 MOBY-DICK \n\nMountains whence they came. In some things you would \nthink them but a few hours old. Look there ! that chap \nstrutting round the corner. He wears a beaver hat and \nswallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor -belt and a sheath- \nknife. Here comes another with a sou '-wester and a \nbombazine cloak. \n\nNo town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred \none I mean a downright bumpkin dandy a fellow that, \nin the dog-days, will mow his two acres in buckskin \ngloves for fear of tanning his hands. Now when a country \ndandy like this takes it into his head to make a distin- \nguished reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you \nshould see the comical things he does upon reaching the \nseaport. In bespeaking his sea -out fit, he orders bell- \nbuttons to his waistcoats ; straps to his canvas trowsers. \nAh, poor Hay-Seed ! how bitterly will burst those straps \nin the first howling gale, when thou art driven, straps/ \nbuttons, and all, down the throat of the tempest. \n\nBut think not that this famous town has only har- \npooneers, cannibals, and bumpkins to show her visitors. \nNot at all. Still New Bedford is a queer place. Had it \nnot been for us whalemen, that tract of land would this \nday perhaps have been in as howling condition as the \ncoast of Labrador. As it is, parts of her back country \nare enough to frighten one, they look so bony. The town \nitself is perhaps the dearest place to live in, hi all New \nEngland. It is a land of oil, true enough : but not like \nCaanan ; a land, also, of corn and wine. The streets do \nnot run with milk ; nor in the spring-time do they pave \nthem with fresh eggs. Yet, in spite of this, nowhere in \nall America will you find more patrician-like houses ; \nparks and gardens more opulent, than hi New Bedford. \nWhence came they ? how planted upon this once scraggy \nscoria of a country ? \n\nGo and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE STREET 41 \n\nround yonder lofty mansion, and your question will be \nanswered. Yes ; all these brave houses and flowery \ngardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. \nOne and all, they were harpooned and dragged up hither \nfrom the bottom of the sea. Can Herr Alexander per- \nform a feat like that ? \n\nIn New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for \ndowers to their daughters, and portion off their nieces \nwith a few porpoises apiece. You must go to New Bed- \nford to see a brilliant wedding ; for, they say, they have \nreservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly \nburn their lengths in spermaceti candles. \n\nIn summer time, the town is sweet to see ; full of fine \nmaples long avenues of green and gold. And in August, \nhigh in air, the beautiful and bountiful horse-chestnuts, \ncandelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by their tapering \nupright cones of congregated blossoms. So omnipotent \\ \nis art ; which in many a district of New Bedford has \nsuperinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren \nrefuse rocks thrown aside at Creation's final day. \n\nAnd the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their \nown red roses. But roses only bloom in summer ; whereas \nthe fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial as sunlight \nin the seventh heavens. Elsewhere match that bloom \nof theirs, ye cannot, save in Salem, where they tell me \nthe young girls breathe such musk, their sailor sweet- \nhearts smell them miles off shore, as though they were \ndrawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of the Puritanic \nsands. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII \n\nTHE CHAPEL \n\nIN this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman's \nChapel, and few are the moody fishermen, shortly bound \nfor the Indian Ocean or Pacific, who fail to make a Sunday \nvisit to the spot. I am sure that I did not. \n\nReturning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied \nout upon this special errand. The sky had changed from \nclear, sunny cold, to driving sleet and mist. Wrapping \nmyself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin, \nI fought my way against the stubborn storm. Entering, \nI found a small scattered congregation of sailors, and \nsailors' wives and widows. A muffled silence reigned, \nonly broken at times by the shrieks of the storm. Each \nsilent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from \nthe other, as if each silent grief were insular and incom- \nmunicable. The chaplain had not yet arrived ; and there \nthese silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly \neyeing several marble tablets, with black borders, masoned \ninto the wall on either side the pulpit. Three of them \nran something like the following, but I do not pretend to \nquote : \n\nSACRED \n\n\n\nOF \n\nJOHN TALBOT, \n\nWho, at the age of eighteen, was lost overboard, \n\nNear the Isle of Desolation, off Patagonia, \n\nNovember 1st, 1836. \n\nTHIS TABLET \n\nIs erected to his Memory \n\nBY HIS SISTER. \n\n\n\n42 \n\n\n\nTHE CHAPEL 43 \n\nSACRED \n\n^o tlje em orp \n\nOF \n\nROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY, \n\nNATHAN COLEMAN, WALTER CANNY, SETH MACY, \n\nAND SAMUEL GLEIG, \n\nForming one of the boats' crews \nOF \n\nTHE SHIP ELIZA, \n\nWho were towed out of sight by a Whale, \nOn the Ofi-shore Ground in the \n\nPACIFIC, \nDecember 3lst, 1839. \n\nTHIS MABBLB \n\nIs here placed by their surviving \nShipmates \n\n\n\nSACKED \n\nEo tfje \n\nOF \n\nThe late \n\nCAPTAIN EZEKIEL HARDY, \n\nWho in the bows of his boat was killed by a \n\nSperm Whale on the coast of Japan, \n\nAugust 3d, 1833. \n\nTHIS TABLET \n\nIs erected to his Memory \nBY \n\nHIS WIDOW. \n\nShaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, \nI seated myself near the door, and turning sideways was \nsurprised to see Queequeg near me. Affected by the \nsolemnity of the scene, there was a wondering gaze of \nincredulous curiosity in his countenance. This savage \nwas the only person present who seemed to notice my \nentrance ; because he was the only one who could not \nread, and, therefore, was not reading those frigid inscrip- \ntions on the wall. Whether any of the relatives of the \n\n\n\n44 MOBY-DICK \n\nseamen whose names appeared there were now among \nthe congregation, I knew not ; but so many are the unre- \ncorded accidents in the fishery, and so plainly did several \nwomen present wear the countenance if not the trappings \nof some unceasing grief, that I feel sure that here before \nme were assembled those, in whose unhealing hearts the \nsight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the \nold wounds to bleed afresh. \n\nOh ! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass ; \nwho standing among flowers can say here, here lies my \nbeloved ; ye know not the desolation that broods in \nbosoms like these. What bitter blanks in those black- \nbordered marbles which cover no ashes ! What despair \nin those immovable inscriptions ! What deadly voids \nand unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw \nupon all Faith, and refuse resurrections to the beings who \nhave placelessly perished without a grave. As well might \nthose tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as here. \n\nLi what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind \nare included ; why it is that a universal proverb says of \nthem, that they tell no tales, though containing more \nsecrets than the Goodwin Sands ; how it is that to his \nname who yesterday departed for the other world, we \nprefix so significant and infidel a word, and yet do not \nthus entitle him, if he but embarks for the remotest Indies \nof this living earth ; why the Life Insurance Companies \npay death-forfeitures upon immortals ; in what eternal, \nunstirring paralysis, and deadly, hopeless trance, yet lies \nantique Adam who died sixty round centuries ago ; how \nit is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we \nnevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss ; \nwhy all the living so strive to hush all the dead ; wherefore \nbut the rumour of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a \nwhole city. All these things are not without their \nmeanings. \n\n\n\nTHE CHAPEL 45 \n\nBut Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and \neven from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital \nhope. \n\nIt needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the \neve of a Nantucket voyage, I regarded those marble \ntablets, and by the murky light of that darkened, doleful \nday read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before \nme. Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine. But \nsomehow I grew merry again. Delightful inducements to \nembark, fine chance for promotion, it seems ay, a \nstove boat will make me an immortal by brevet. Yes, \nthere is death in this business of whaling a speechlessly \nquick chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity. But what \nthen ? Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter \nof Life and Death. Methinks that what they call my \nshadow here on earth is my true substance. Methinks \nthat in looking at things spiritual, we are too much like \noysters observing the sun through the water, and thinking \nthat thick water the thinnest of air. Methinks my body \nis but the lees of my better being. In fact, take my body \nwho will, take it I say, it is not me. And therefore three \ncheers for Nantucket ; and come a stove boat and stove \nbody when they will, for stave my soul, Jove himself \ncannot. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII \n\nTHE PULPIT \n\nI HAD not been seated very long ere a man of a certain \nvenerable robustness entered ; immediately as the storm- \npelted door flew back upon admitting him, a quick regard- \nful eyeing of him by all the congregation sufficiently \nattested that this fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, \nit was the famous Father Mapple, so called by the whale- \nmen, among whom he was a very great favourite. He \nhad been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for \nmany years past had dedicated his life to the ministry. \nAt the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the \nhardy winter of a healthy old age ; that sort of old age \nwhich seems merging into a second flowering youth, for \namong all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain \nmild gleams of a newly developing bloom the spring \nverdure peeping forth even beneath February's snow. \nNo one having previously heard his history, could for \nthe first time behold Father Mapple without the utmost \ninterest, because there were certain engrafted clerical \npeculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous \nmaritime life he had led. When he entered I observed \nthat he carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come \nin his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting \nsleet, and his great pilot-cloth jacket seemed almost to \ndrag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had \nabsorbed. However, hat and coat and overshoes were \none by one removed, and hung up in a little space in an \nadjacent corner ; when, arrayed in a decent suit, he \nquietly approached the pulpit. \n\n46 \n\n\n\nTHE PULPIT 47 \n\nLike most old-fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, \nand since a regular stairs to such a height would, by its \nlong angle with the floor, seriously contract the already \nsmall area of the chapel, the architect, it seemed, had \nacted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and finished the \npulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side \nladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at \nsea. The wife of a whaling-captain had provided the chapel \nwith a handsome pair of red worsted man-ropes for this \nladder, which, being itself nicely headed, and stained with \na mahogany colour, the whole contrivance, considering \nwhat manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad \ntaste. Halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder, \nand with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs \nof the man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upward, \nand then with a truly sailor-like but still reverential \ndexterity, hand over hand, mounted the steps as if \nascending the main -top of his vessel. \n\nThe perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually \nthe case with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, \nonly the rounds were of wood, so that at every step there \nwas a joint. At my first glimpse of the pulpit, it had not \nescaped me that however convenient for a ship, these \njoints in the present instance seemed unnecessary. For \nI was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining \nthe height, slowly turn round, and stooping over the \npulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder step by step, till \nthe whole was deposited within, leaving him impregnable \nin his little Quebec. \n\nI pondered some time without fully comprehending \nthe reason for this. Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide \nreputation for sincerity and sanctity, that I could not \nsuspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of \nthe stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober \nreason for this thing ; furthermore, it must symbolise \n\n\n\n48 MOBY-DICK \n\nsomething unseen. Can it be, then, that by that act of \nphysical isolation, he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for \nthe time, from all outward worldly ties and connections ? \nYes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the word, \nto the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is a self- \ncontaining stronghold a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a \nperennial well of water within the walls. \n\nBut the side ladder was not the only strange feature \nof the place, borrowed from the chaplain's former sea- \nfarings. Between the marble cenotaphs on either hand \nof the pulpit, the wall which formed its back was adorned \nwith a large painting representing a gallant ship beating \nagainst a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and \nsnowy breakers. But high above the flying scud and \ndark-rolling clouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight, \nfrom which beamed forth an angel's face ; and this bright \nface shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ship's tossed \ndeck, something like that silver plate now inserted into the \nVictory's plank where Nelson fell. ' Ah, noble ship/ the \nangel seemed to say, 'beat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and \nbear a hardy helm ; for lo ! the sun is breaking through ; \nthe clouds are rolling off serenest azure is at hand.' \n\nNor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same \nsea -taste that had achieved the ladder and the picture. \nIts panelled front was in the likeness of a ship's bluff bows, \nand the Holy Bible rested on a projecting piece of scroll \nwork, fashioned after a ship's fiddle -headed beak. \n\nWhat could be more full of meaning ? for the pulpit \nis ever this earth's foremost part ; all the rest comes in \nits rear ; the pulpit leads the world. From thence it is \nthe storm of God's quick wrath is first descried, and the \nbow must bear the earliest brunt. From thence it is the \nGod of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable \nwinds. Yes, the world 's a ship on its passage out, and \nnot a voyage complete ; and the pulpit is its prow. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX \n\n\n\nTHE SERMON \n\nFATHER MAPPLE rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming \nauthority ordered the scattered people to condense. \n' Starboard gangway, there ! side away to larboard \nlarboard gangway to starboard ! Midships ! midships ! ' \n\nThere was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the \nbenches, and a still slighter shuffling of women's shoes, \nand all was quiet again, and every eye on the preacher. \n\nHe paused a little ; then kneeling in the pulpit's bows, \nfolded his large brown hands across his chest, uplifted \nhis closed eyes, and offered a prayer so deeply devout \nthat he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of \nthe sea. \n\nThis ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual \ntolling of a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog \nin such tones he commenced reading the following hymn ; \nbut changing his manner toward the concluding stanzas, \nburst forth with a pealing exultation and joy : \n\n* The ribs and terrors in the whale \n\nArched over me a dismal gloom, \nWhile all God's sun-lit waves rolled by, \nAnd lift me deepening down to doom. \n\n' I saw the opening maw of hell, \n\nWith endless pains and sorrows there ; \nWhich none but they that feel can tell \nOh, I was plunging to despair. \n\nVOL. I. D \n\n\n\n50 MOBY-DICK \n\n4 In black distress, I called my God, \n\nWhen I could scarce believe him mine, \nHe bowed his ear to my complaints \nNo more the whale did me confine. \n\n' With speed he flew to my relief, \n\nAs on a radiant dolphin borne ; \nAwful, yet bright, as lightning shone \nThe face of my Deliverer God. \n\n' My song for ever shall record \n\nThat terrible, that joyful hour ; \nI give the glory to my God, \n\nHis all the mercy and the power.' \n\nNearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled \nhigh above the howling of the storm. A brief pause \nensued ; the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of \nthe Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon the \nproper page, said : ' Beloved shipmates, clinch the last \nverse of the first chapter of Jonah \" And God had pre- \npared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.\" \n\n' Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters \nfour yarns is one of the smallest strands in the mighty \ncable of the Scriptures. Yet what depths of the soul does \nJonah's deep sea-line sound ! what a pregnant lesson to \nus is this prophet ! What a noble thing is that canticle \nin the fish's belly ! How billow-like and boisterously \ngrand ! We feel the floods surging over us ; we sound with \nhim to the kelpy bottom of the waters ; sea-weed and all \nthe slime of the sea is about us ! But what is this lesson \nthat the book of Jonah teaches ? Shipmates, it is a two- \nstranded lesson ; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a \nlesson to me as a pilot of the living God. As sinful men, \nit is a lesson to us all, because it is a story of the sin, hard- \nheartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift punish- ! \n\n\n\nTHE SERMON 51 \n\nment, repentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and \njoy of Jonah. As with all sinners among men, the sin \nof this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the \ncommand of God never mind now what that command \nwas, or how conveyed which he found a hard command. \nBut all the things that God would have us do are hard for \nus to do remember that and hence, He oftener com- \nmands us than endeavours to persuade. And if we obey \nGod, we must disobey ourselves ; and it is in this dis- \nobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God \nconsists. \n\n' With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still \nfurther flouts at God, by seeking to flee from Him. He \nthinks that a ship made by men will carry him into \ncountries where God does not reign, but only the captains \nof this earth. He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, \nand seeks a ship that 's bound for Tarshish. There lurks, \nperhaps, a hitherto unheeded meaning here. By all \naccounts Tarshish could have been no other city than the \nmodern Cadiz. That 's the opinion of learned men. And \nwhere is Cadiz, shipmates ? Cadiz is in Spain ; as far by \nwater, from Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed \nin those ancient days, when the Atlantic was an almost \nunknown sea. Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa, ship- \nmates, is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean, \nthe Syrian ; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand \nmiles to the westward from that, just outside the Straits \nof Gibraltar. See ye not then, shipmates, that Jonah \nsought to flee world- wide from God ? Miserable man ! \nOh ! most contemptible and worthy of all scorn ; with \nslouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God ; \nprowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening \nto cross the seas. So disordered, self -condemning is his \nlook, that had there been policemen in those days, Jonah, \non the mere suspicion of something wrong, had been \n\n\n\n52 MOBY-DICK \n\narrested ere he touched a deck. How plainly he 's a \nfugitive ! no baggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet- \nbag, no friends accompany him to the wharf with their \nadieux. At last, after much dodging search, he finds the \nTarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo ; and \nas he steps on board to see its captain in the cabin, all \nthe sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the \ngoods, to mark the stranger's evil eye. Jonah sees this ; \nbut in vain he tries to look ah 1 ease and confidence ; in \nvain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the \nman assure the mariners he can be no innocent. In their \ngamesome but still serious way, one whispers to the other \n\" Jack, he 's robbed a widow \" ; or, \" Joe, do you mark \nhim ; he 's a bigamist \" ; or, \" Harry, lad, I guess he 's the \nadulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike, one \nof the missing murderers from Sodom.\" Another runs \nto read the bill that 's stuck against the spile upon the \nwharf to which the ship is moored, offering five hundred \ngold coins for the apprehension of a. parricide, and con- \ntaining a description of his person. He reads, and looks \nfrom Jonah to the bill ; while all his sympathetic ship- \nmates now crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their \nhands upon him. Frighted Jonah trembles, and summon- \ning all his boldness to his face, only looks so much the \nmore a coward. He will not confess himself suspected ; \nbut that itself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best \nof it ; and when the sailors find him not to be the man that \nis advertised, they let him pass, and he descends into the \ncabin. \n\n' \" Who 's there ? \" cries the captain at his busy desk, \nhurriedly making out his papers for the Customs \"Who 's \nthere ? \" Oh ! how that harmless question mangles \nJonah ! For the instant he almost turns to flee again. \nBut he rallies. \" I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish ; \nhow soon sail ye, sir ? \" Thus far the busy captain had \n\n\n\nTHE SERMON 53 \n\nnot looked up to Jonah, though the man now stands \nbefore him ; but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice, \nthan he darts a scrutinising glance. \" We sail with the \nnext coming tide,\" at last he slowly answered, still \nintently eyeing him. \" No sooner, sir ? \" \" Soon enough \nfor any honest man that goes a passenger.\" Ha ! Jonah, \nthat 's another stab. But he swiftly calls away the \ncaptain from that scent. \" I '11 sail with ye,\" he says, \n\" the passage money, how much is that ? I '11 pay \nnow.\" For it is particularly written, shipmates, as if it \nwere a thing not to be overlooked in this history, \" that \nhe paid the fare thereof \" ere the craft did sail. And \ntaken with the context, this is full of meaning. \n\n' Now Jonah's captain, shipmates, was one whose dis- \ncernment detects crime in any, but whose cupidity exposes \nit only in the penniless. In this world, shipmates, sin \nthat pays its way can travel freely, and without a pass- \nport ; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all \nfrontiers. So Jonah's captain prepares to test the length \nof Jonah's purse, ere he judge him openly. He charges \nhim thrice the usual sum ; and it 's assented to. Then \nthe captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive ; but at the \nsame time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with \ngold. Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent \nsuspicions still molest the captain. He rings every coin \nto find a counterfeit. Not a forger, anyway, he mutters ; \nand Jonah is put down for his passage. \" Point out my \nstate-room, sir,\" says Jonah now, \" I 'm travel- weary ; \nI need sleep.\" \"Thou look'st like it,\" says the captain, \n\" there 's thy room.\" Jonah enters, and would lock the \ndoor, but the lock contains no key. Hearing him foolishly \nfumbling there, the captain laughs lowly to himself, and \nmutters something about the doors of convicts' cells being \nnever allowed to be locked within. All dressed and dusty \nas he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth, and finds \n\n\n\n54 MOBY-DICK \n\nthe little state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead. \nThe air is close, and Jonah gasps. Then, in that con- \ntracted hole, sunk, too, beneath the ship's water-line, \nJonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling \nhour, when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of \nhis bowel's wards. \n\n' Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp \nslightly oscillates in Jonah's room ; and the ship, heeling \nover toward the wharf with the weight of the last bales \nreceived, the lamp, flame and all, though in slight motion, \nstill maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to \nthe room ; though, in truth, infallibly straight itself, it \nbut made obvious the false, lying levels among which it \nhung. The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah ; as lying \nin his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place, and \nthis thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his \nrestless glance. But that contradiction in the lamp more \nand more appals him. The floor, the ceiling, and the \nside, are all awry. \" Oh ! so my conscience hangs in \nme ! \" he groans, \" straight upward, so it burns ; but the \nchambers of my soul are all in crookedness ! \" \n\n' Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies \nto his bed, still reeling, but with conscience yet pricking \nhim, as the plungings of the Roman race -horse but so \nmuch the more strike his steel tags into him ; as one who \nin that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy \nanguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be \npassed ; and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep \nstupor steals over him, as over the man who bleeds to \ndeath, for conscience is the wound, and there 's naught \nto staunch it ; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth, \nJonah's prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning \ndown to sleep. \n\nc And now the time of tide has come ; the ship casts \noff her cables ; and from the deserted wharf the un- \n\n\n\nTHE SERMON 55 \n\ncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening, glides to sea. \nThat ship, my friends, was the first of recorded smugglers ! \nthe contraband was Jonah. But the sea rebels ; he will \nnot bear the wicked burden. A dreadful storm comes on, \nthe ship is like to break. But now when the boatswain \ncalls all hands to lighten her ; when boxes, bales, and \njars are clattering overboard ; when the wind is shrieking, \nand the men are yelling, and every plank thunders with \ntrampling feet right over Jonah's head ; in all this raging \ntumult, Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees no black \nsky and raging sea, feels not the reeling timbers, and little \nhears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale, \nwhich even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas \nafter him. Ay, shipmates, Jonah was gone down into \nthe sides of the ship a berth in the cabin as I have taken \nit and was fast asleep. But the frightened master comes \nto him, and shrieks hi his dead ear, \" What meanest thou, \nsleeper ! arise ! \" Startled from his lethargy by that \ndireful cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and stumbling to \nthe deck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon the sea. But \nat that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow \nleaping over the bulwarks. Wave after wave thus leaps \ninto the ship, and finding no speedy vent runs roaring \nfore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning \nwhile yet afloat. And ever, as the white moon shows her \naffrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness \noverhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing \nhigh upward, but soon beat downward again toward the \ntormented deep. \n\n' Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. \nIn all his cringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too \nplainly known. The sailors mark him ; more and more \ncertain grow their suspicions of him, and at last, fully \nto test the truth, by referring the whole matter to high \nHeaven, they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause \n\n\n\n56 MOBY-DICK \n\nthis great tempest was upon them. The lot is Jonah's ; \nthat discovered, then how furiously they mob him with \ntheir questions. \" What is thine occupation ? Whence \ncomest thou ? Thy country ? What people ? \" But \nmark now, my shipmates, the behaviour of poor Jonah. \nThe eager mariners but ask him who he is, and where \nfrom ; whereas, they not only receive an answer to those \nquestions, but likewise another answer to a question not \nput by them, but the unsolicited answer is forced from \nJonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him. \n\n' \" I am a Hebrew,\" he cries and then \" I fear the \nLord the God of Heaven who hath made the sea and the \ndry land ! \" Fear him, O Jonah ? Ay, well mightest \nthou fear the Lord God then ! Straightway, he now goes \non to make a full confession ; whereupon the mariners \nbecame more and more appalled, but still are pitiful. \nFor when Jonah, not yet supplicating God for mercy, \nsince he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts, \nwhen wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and \ncast him forth into the sea, for he knew that for his sake \nthis great tempest was upon them ; they mercifully turn \nfrom him, and seek by other means to save the ship. \nBut all in vain ; the indignant gale howls louder ; then, \nwith one hand raised invokingly to God, with the other \nthey not unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah. \n\n' And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and \ndropped into the sea ; when instantly an oily calmness \nfloats out from the east, and the sea is still, as Jonah \ncarries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water \nbehind. He goes down in the whirling heart of such a \nmasterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment \nwhen he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting \nhim ; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory teeth, like so \nmany white bolts, upon his prison. Then Jonah prayed \nunto the Lord out of the fish's belly. But observe his \n\n\n\nTHE SERMON 57 \n\nprayer, and learn a weighty lesson. For sinful as he is, \nJonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance. \nHe feels that his dreadful punishment is just. He leaves \nall his deliverance to God, contenting himself with this, \nthat spite of all his pains and pangs, he will still look \ntoward His holy temple. And here, shipmates, is true \nand faithful repentance ; not clamorous for pardon, but \ngrateful for punishment. And how pleasing to God was \nthis conduct in Jonah, is shown in the eventual deliver- \nance of him from the sea and the whale. Shipmates, I \ndo not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin, \nbut I do place him before you as a model for repentance. \nSin not ; but if you do, take heed to repent of it like Jonah. ' \n\nWhile he was speaking these words, the howling of the \nshrieking, slanting storm without seemed to add new \npower to the preacher, who, when describing Jonah's sea- \nstorm, seemed tossed by a storm himself. His deep chest \nheaved as with a ground-swell ; his tossed arms seemed \nthe warring elements at work ; and the thunders that \nrolled away from off his swarthy brow, and the light \nleaping from his eye, made all his simple hearers look on \nhim with a quick fear that was strange to them. \n\nThere now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned \nover the leaves of the Book once more ; and, at last, \nstanding motionless, with closed eyes, for the moment, \nseemed communing with God and himself. \n\nBut again he leaned over toward the people, and \nbowing his head lowly, with an aspect of the deepest \nyet manliest humility, he spake these words : \n\nc Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you ; \nboth his hands press upon me. I have read ye by what \nmurky light may be mine the lesson that Jonah teaches \nto all sinners ; and therefore to ye, and still more to me, \nfor I am a greater sinner than ye. And now how gladly \nwould I come down from this mast-head and sit on the \n\n\n\n58 MOBY-DICK \n\nhatches there where you sit, and listen as you listen, \nwhile some one of you reads me that other and more \nawful lesson which Jonah teaches to me, as a pilot of the \nliving God. How being an anointed pilot -prophet, or \nspeaker of true things, and bidden by the Lord to sound \nthose unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh, \nJonah, appalled at the hostility he should raise, fled from \nhis mission, and sought to escape his duty and his God by \ntaking ship at Joppa. But God is everywhere ; Tarshish \nhe never reached. As we have seen, God came upon him \nin the whale, and swallowed him down to living gulfs \nof doom, and with swift slantings tore him along \" into \nthe midst of the seas,\" where the eddying depths sucked \nhim ten thousand fathoms down, and \" the weeds were \nwrapped about his head,\" and all the watery world of woe \nbowled over him. Yet even then beyond the reach of any \nplummet \" out of the belly of hell \" when the whale \ngrounded upon the ocean's utmost bones, even then, God \nheard the engulphed, repenting prophet when he cried. \nThen God spake unto the fish ; and from the shuddering \ncold and blackness of the sea, the whale came breaching \nup toward the warm and pleasant sun, and all the delights \nof air and earth ; and \" vomited out Jonah upon the dry \nland \" ; when the word of the Lord came a second time ; \nand Jonah, bruised and beaten his ears, like two sea- \nshells, still multitudinously murmuring of the ocean \nJonah did the Almighty's bidding. And what was that, \nshipmates ? To preach the Truth to the face of False- \nhood ! That was it ! \n\n' This, shipmates, this is that other lesson ; and we \nto that pilot of the living God who slights it. Woe to \nhim whom this world charms from Gospel duty ! Woe \nto him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God \nhas brewed them into a gale ! Woe to him who seeks \nto please rather than to appal ! Woe to him whose good \n\n\n\nTHE SERMON 59 \n\nname is more to him than goodness ! Woe to him who, \nin this world, courts not dishonour ! Woe to him who \nwould not be true, even though to be false were salva- \ntion ! Yea, woe to him who, as the great Pilot Paul has \nit, while preaching to others is himself a castaway ! ' \n\nHe drooped and fell away from himself for a moment ; \nthen lifting his face to them again, showed a deep joy \nin his eyes, as he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasm, \n' But oh ! shipmates ! on the starboard hand of every \nwoe, there is a sure delight ; and higher the top of that \ndelight, than the bottom of the woe is deep. Is not the \nmain-truck higher than the kelson is low ? Delight is to \nhim a far, far upward, and inward delight who against \nthe proud gods and commodores of this earth, ever stands \nforth his own inexorable self. Delight is to him whose \nstrong arms yet support him, when the ship of this base \ntreacherous world has gone down beneath him. Delight \nis to him, who gives no quarter in the truth, and kills, \nburns, and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from \nunder the robes of Senators and Judges. Delight, top- \ngallant delight is to him, who acknowledges no law or \nlord, but the Lord his God, and is only a patriot to heaven. \nDelight is to him, whom all the waves of the billows of \nthe seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this \nsure Keel of the Ages. And eternal delight and delicious- \nness will be his, who coming to lay him down, can say with \nhis final breath Father ! chiefly known to me by \nThy rod mortal or immortal, here I die. I have striven \nto be Thine, more than to be this world's, or mine own. \nYet this is nothing ; I leave eternity to Thee ; for what \nis man that he should live out the lifetime of his God 1 ' \n\nHe said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, \ncovered his face with his hands, and so remained kneeling, \ntill all the people had departed, and he was left alone in \nthe place. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER X \n\nA BOSOM FRIEND \n\nRETURNING to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found \nQueequeg there quite alone ; he having left the Chapel \nbefore the benediction some time. He was sitting on a \nbench before the fire, with his feet on the stove hearth, \nand in one hand was holding close up to his face that \nlittle negro idol of his ; peering hard into its face, and \nwith a jack-knife gently whittling away at its nose, \nmeanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way. \n\nBut being now interrupted, he put up the image ; and \npretty soon, going to the table, took up a large book there, \nand placing it on his lap began counting the pages with \ndeliberate regularity ; at every fiftieth page as I fancied \nstopping a moment, looking vacantly around him, \nand giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle \nof astonishment. He would then begin again at the next \nfifty ; seeming to commence at number one each time, \nas though he could not count more than fifty, and it \nwas only by such a large number of fifties being found \ntogether, that his astonishment at the multitude of pages \nwas excited. \n\nWith much interest I sat watching him. Savage \nthough he was, and hideously marred about the face \nat least to my taste his countenance yet had a something \nin it which was by no means disagreeable. You cannot \nhide the soul. Through all his unearthly tattooings, I \nthought I saw the traces of a simple honest heart ; and \nin his large, deep eyes, fiery black and bold, there seemed \n\n60 \n\n\n\nA BOSOM FRIEND 61 \n\ntokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils. \nAnd besides all this, there was a certain lofty bearing \nabout the pagan, which even his uncouthness could not \naltogether maim. He looked like a man who had never \ncringed and never had had a creditor. Whether it was, \ntoo, that his head being shaved, his forehead was drawn \nout in freer and brighter relief, and looked more expansive \nthan it otherwise would, this I will not venture to decide ; \nbut certain it was his head was phrenologically an ex- \ncellent one. It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded me \nof General Washington's head, as seen in the popular \nbusts of him. It had the same long regularly graded \nretreating slope from above the brows, which were like- \nwise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly \nwooded on top. Queequeg was George Washington \ncannibalistically developed. \n\nWhilst I was thus closely scanning him, half pretending \nmeanwhile to be looking out at the storm from the case- \nment, he never heeded my presence, never troubled him- \nself with so much as a single glance ; but appeared wholly \noccupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book. \nConsidering how sociably we had been sleeping together \nthe night previous, and especially considering the affection- \nate arm I had found thrown over me upon waking in the \nmorning, I thought this indifference of his very strange. \nBut savages are strange beings ; at times you do not \nknow exactly how to take them. At first they are over- \nawing ; their calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems \na Socratic wisdom. I had noticed also that Queequeg \nnever consorted at all, or but very little, with the other \nseamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever ; \nappeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his \nacquaintances. All this struck me as mighty singular ; \nyet, upon second thoughts, there was something almost \nsublime in it. Here was a man some twenty thousand \n\n\n\nI \n\n\n\n62 MOBY-DICK \n\nmiles from home, by the way of Cape Horn, that is \nwhich was the only way he could get there thrown \namong people as strange to him as though he were in the \nplanet Jupiter ; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease ; \npreserving the utmost serenity ; content with his own \ncompanionship ; always equal to himself. Surely this \nwas a touch of fine philosophy ; though no doubt he had \nnever heard there was such a thing as that. But, per- \nhaps, to be true philosophers, we mortals should not \nbe conscious of so living or so striving. So soon as I \nhear that such or such a man gives himself out for a \nphilosopher, I conclude that, like the dyspeptic old woman, \nhe must have ' broken his digester.' \n\nAs I sat there in that now lonely room ; the fire burn- \ning low, in that mild stage when, after its first intensity \nhas warmed the air, it then only glows to be looked at ; \nthe evening shades and phantoms gathering round the \ncasements, and peering in upon us silent, solitary twain ; \nthe storm booming without in solemn swells ; I began to \nbe sensible of strange feelings. I felt a melting in me. \nNo more my splintered heart and maddened hand were \nturned against the wolfish world. This soothing savage \nhad redeemed it. There he sat, his very indifference \nspeaking a nature in which there lurked no civilised \nhypocrisies and bland deceits. Wild he was ; a very \nsight of sights to see ; yet I began to feel myself mysteri- \nously drawn toward him. And those same things that \nwould have repelled most others, they were the very \nmagnets that thus drew me. 1 11 try a pagan friend, \nthought I, since Christian kindness has proved but hollow \ncourtesy. I drew my bench near him, and made some \nfriendly signs and hints, doing my best to talk with him \nmeanwhile. At first he little noticed these advances ; \nbut presently, upon my referring to his last night's \nhospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we were \n\n\n\nA BOSOM FRIEND \n\n\n\n63 \n\n\n\nagain to be bedfellows. I told him yes ; whereat I \nthought he looked pleased, perhaps a little complimented. \n\nWe then turned over the book together, and I en- \ndeavoured to explain to him the purpose of the printing, \nand the meaning of the few pictures that were in it. Thus \nI soon engaged his interest ; and from that we went to \njabbering the best we could about the various outer sights \nto be seen in this famous town. Soon I proposed a social \nsmoke ; and, producing his pouch and tomahawk, he \nquietly offered me a puff. And then we sat exchanging \npuffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping it regularly \npassing between us. \n\nIf there yet lurked any ice of indifference toward me \nin the pagan's breast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had \nsoon thawed it out, and left us cronies. He seemed to \ntake to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as I to him ; \nand when our smoke was over, he pressed his forehead \nagainst mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that \nhenceforth we were married ; meaning, in his country's \nphrase, that we were bosom friends ; he would gladly \ndie for me, if need should be. In a countryman this \nsudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too \npremature, a thing to be much distrusted ; but in this \nsimple savage those old rules would not apply. \n\nAfter supper, and another social chat and smoke, we \nwent to our room together. He made me a present of \nhis embalmed head ; took out his enormous tobacco \nwallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out some \nthirty dollars in silver ; then spreading them on the \ntable, and mechanically dividing them into two equal \nportions, pushed one of them toward me, and said it was \nmine. I was going to remonstrate ; but he silenced me \nby pouring them into my trowsers' pockets. I let them \nstay. He then went about his evening prayers, took \nout his idol, and removed the paper fire-board. By \n\n\n\n64 MOBY-DICK \n\ncertain signs and symptoms, I thought he seemed anxious \nfor me to join him ; but well knowing what was to follow, \nI deliberated a moment whether, in case he invited me, \nI would comply or otherwise. \n\nI was a good Christian ; born and bred in the bosom \nof the infallible Presbyterian Church. How then could \nI unite with this wild idolater in worshipping his piece of \nwood ? But what is worship ? thought I. Do you \nsuppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of \nheaven and earth pagans and all included can possibly \nbe jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood ? Im- \npossible ! But what is worship ? to do the will of \nGod ? that is worship. And what is the will of God ? \nto do to my fellow-man what I would have my fellow-man \nto do to me that is the will of God. Now, Queequeg is \nmy fellow- man. And what do I wish that this Queequeg \nwould do to me ? Why, unite with me in my particular \nPresbyterian form of worship. Consequently, I must \nthen unite with him in his ; ergo, I must turn idolater. \nSo I kindled the shavings ; helped prop up the innocent \nlittle idol ; offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg ; \nsalaamed before him twice or thrice ; kissed his nose ; \nand that done, we undressed and went to bed, at peace \nwith our own consciences and all the world. But we \ndid not go to sleep without some little chat. \n\nHow it is I know not ; but there is no place like a bed \nfor confidential disclosures between friends. Man and \nwife, they say, there open the very bottom of their souls \nto each other ; and some old couples often lie and chat \nover old times till nearly morning. Thus, then, in our \nhearts' honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg a cosy, loving \npair. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI \n\nNIGHTGOWN \n\nWE had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short \nintervals, and Queequeg now and then affectionately \nthrowing his brown tattooed legs over mine, and then \ndrawing them back ; so entirely sociable and free and easy \nwere we ; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations, \nwhat little nappishness remained in us altogether departed, \nand we felt like getting up again, though day-break was \nyet some way down the future. \n\nYes, we became very wakeful ; so much so that our \nrecumbent position began to grow wearisome, and by \nlittle and little we found ourselves sitting up ; the clothes \nwell tucked around us, leaning against the head-board \nwith our four knees drawn up close together, and our two \nnoses bending over them, as if our knee-pans were warm- \ning-pans. We felt very nice and snug, the more so since \nit was so chilly out of doors ; indeed out of bed-clothes \ntoo, seeing that there was no fire in the room. The more \nso, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some \nsmall part of you must be cold, for there is no quality \nin this world that is not what it is merely by contrast. \nNothing exists in itself. If you flatter yourself that you \nare all over comfortable, and have been so a long time, \nthen you cannot be said to be comfortable any more. \nBut if, like Queequeg and me in the bed, the tip of your \nnose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled, why \nthen, indeed, in the general consciousness you feel most \ndelightfully and unmistakably warm. For this reason \n\nVOL. i. E \n\n\n\n66 MOBY-DICK \n\na sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a \nfire, which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich. \nFor the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have \nnothing but the blanket between you and your snugness \nand the cold of the outer air. Then there you lie \nlike the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic \ncrystal. \n\nWe had been sitting in this crouching manner for some \ntime, when all at once I thought I would open my eyes ; \nfor when between sheets, whether by day or by night, \nand whether asleep or awake, I have a way of always \nkeeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate \nthe snugness of being in bed. Because no man can ever \nfeel his own identity aright except his eyes be closed ; as \nif darkness were indeed the proper element of our essences, \nthough light be more congenial to our clayey part. Upon \nopening my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleasant \nand self-created darkness into the imposed and coarse \nouter gloom of the unilluminated twelve-o'clock-at-night, \nI experienced a disagreeable revulsion. Nor did I at all \nobject to the hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best \nto strike a light, seeing that we were so wide awake ; and \nbesides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs \nfrom his tomahawk. Be it said, that though I had felt \nsuch a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the \nnight before, yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow \nwhen love once comes to bend them. For now I liked \nnothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me, \neven in bed, because he seemed to be full of such serene \nhousehold joy then. I no more felt unduly concerned \nfor the landlord's policy of insurance. I was only alive \nto the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing \na pipe and a blanket with a real friend. With our shaggy \njackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed the \ntomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew \n\n\n\nNIGHTGOWN 67 \n\nover us a blue hanging tester of smoke, illuminated by \nthe flame of the new-lit lamp. \n\nWhether it was that this undulating tester rolled the \nsavage away to far distant scenes, I know not, but he now \nspoke of his native island ; and, eager to hear his history, \nI begged him to go on and tell it. He gladly complied. \nThough at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of \nhis words, yet subsequent disclosures, when I had become \nmore familiar with his broken phraseology, now enable \nme to present the whole story such as it may prove in \nthe mere skeleton I give. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII \n\nBIOGRAPHICAL \n\nQUEEQUEG was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away \nto the west and south. It is not down in any map ; true \nplaces never are. \n\nWhen a new-hatched savage running wild about his \nnative woodlands in a grass clout, followed by the nib- \nbling goats, as if he were a green sapling ; even then, in \nQueequeg's ambitious soul, lurked a strong desire to see \nsomething more of Christendom than a specimen whaler \nor two. His father was a High Chief, a King ; his uncle \na High Priest ; and on the maternal side he boasted aunts \nwho were the wives of unconquerable warriors. There \nwas excellent blood in his veins royal stuff ; though \nsadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he \nnourished in his untutored youth. \n\nA Sag Harbour ship visited his father's bay, and Quee- \nqueg sought a passage to Christian lands. But the ship, \nhaving her full complement of seamen, spurned his suit ; \nand not all the King his father's influence could prevail. \nBut Queequeg vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he \npaddled off to a distant strait, which he knew the ship \nmust pass through when she quitted the island. On one \nside was a coral reef ; on the other a low tongue of land, \ncovered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the \nwater. Hiding his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, \nwith its prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle \nlow in hand ; and when the ship was gliding by, like a \nflash he darted out ; gained her side ; with one backward \n\n68 \n\n\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL 69 \n\ndash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe ; climbed \nup the chains ; and throwing himself at full length upon \nthe deck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and swore not to let \nit go, though hacked in pieces. \n\nIn vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard ; \nsuspended a cutlass over his naked wrists ; Queequeg was \nthe son of a King, and Queequeg budged not. Struck \nby his desperate dauntlessness, and his wild desire to visit \nChristendom, the captain at last relented, and told him \nhe might make himself at home. But this fine young \nsavage this sea Prince of Wales never saw the captain's \ncabin. They put him down among the sailors, and made \na whaleman of him. But like Czar Peter content to toil \nin the shipyards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained no \nseeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily gain the \npower of enlightening his untutored countrymen. For at \nbottom so he told me he was actuated by a profound \ndesire to learn among the Christians, the arts whereby \nto make his people still happier than they were ; and more \nthan that, still better than they were. But, alas ! the \n\\ practices of whalemen soon convinced him that even \nj Christians could be both miserable and wicked ; infinitely \nmore so, than all his father's heathens. Arrived at last \nin old Sag Harbour ; and seeing what the sailors did \nthere ; and then going on to Nantucket, and seeing how \nthey spent their wages in that place also, poor Queequeg \ngave it up for lost. Thought he, it 5 s a wicked world \nin all meridians ; 1 11 die a pagan. \n\nAnd thus an old idolater at heart, he yet lived among \nthese Christians, wore their clothes, and tried to talk their \ngibberish. Hence the queer ways about him, though \nnow some time from home. \n\nBy hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going \nback, and having a coronation ; since he might now \nconsider his father dead and gone, he being very old and \n\n\n\n70 MOBY-DICK \n\nfeeble at the last accounts. He answered no, not yet ; \nand added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather \nChristians, had unfitted him for ascending the pure and \nundefiled throne of thirty pagan kings before him. But \nby and by, he said, he would return, as soon as he felt \nhimself baptized again. For the nonce, however, he \nproposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in all four \noceans. They had made a harpooneer of him, and that \nbarbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now. \n\nI asked him what might be his immediate purpose, \ntouching his future movements. He answered, to go to \nsea again, in his old vocation. Upon this, I told him that \nwhaling was my own design, and informed him of my \nintention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most \npromising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark \nfrom. He at once resolved to accompany me to that \nisland, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the same \nwatch, the same boat, the same mess with me, in short \nto share my every hap ; with both my hands in his, boldly \ndip into the Potluck of both worlds. To all this I joy- \nously assented ; for besides the affection I now felt for \nQueequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such, \ncould not fail to be of great usefulness to one who, like me, \nwas wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling, though \nwell acquainted with the sea as known to merchant \nseamen. \n\nHis story being ended with his pipe's last dying puff, \nQueequeg embraced me, pressed his forehead against \nmine, and blowing out the light, we rolled over from each \nother, this way and that, and very soon were sleeping. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII \n\nWHEELBARROW \n\nNEXT morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed \nhead to a barber, for a block, I settled my own and com- \nrade's bill ; using, however, my comrade's money. The \ngrinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed amaz- \ningly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung \nup between me and Queequeg especially as Peter Coffin's \ncock-and-bull stories about him had previously so much \nalarmed me concerning the very person whom I now \ncompanied with. \n\nWe borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our \nthings, including my own poor carpet-bag, and Quee- \nqueg 's canvas sack and hammock, away we went down to \nthe Moss, the little Nantucket packet schooner moored \nat the wharf. As we were going along the people stared ; \nnot at Queequeg so much for they were used to seeing \ncannibals like him in their streets, but at seeing him \nand me upon such confidential terms. But we heeded \nthem not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, \nand Queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath \non his harpoon barbs. I asked him why he carried such \na troublesome thing with him ashore, and whether all \nwhaling-ships did not find their own harpoons. To this, \nin substance, he replied, that though what I hinted was \ntrue enough, yet he had a particular affection for his own \nharpoon, because it was of assured stuff, well tried in \nmany a mortal combat, and deeply intimate with the \nhearts of whales. In short, like many inland reapers and \n\n71 \n\n\n\n72 MOBY-DICK \n\nmowers, who go into the farmer's meadows armed with \ntheir own scythes though in no wise obliged to furnish \nthem even so, Queequeg, for his own private reasons, \npreferred his own harpoon. \n\nShifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me \na funny story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever \nseen. It was in Sag Harbour. The owners of his ship, \nit seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his heavy \nchest to his boarding-house. Not to seem ignorant about \nthe thing though in truth he was entirely so, concerning \nthe precise way in which to manage the barrow Quee- \nqueg puts his chest upon it ; lashes it fast ; and then \nshoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf. ' Why/ \nsaid I, ' Queequeg, you might have known better than \nthat, one would think. Didn't the people laugh ? ' \n\nUpon this, he told me another story. The people \nof his island of Rokovoko, it seems, at their wedding \nfeasts express the fragrant water of young cocoa-nuts into \na large stained calabash like a punch -bowl ; and this \npunch -bowl always forms the great central ornament on \nthe braided mat where the feast is held. Now a certain \ngrand merchant ship once touched at Rokovoko, and its \ncommander from all accounts a very stately punctilious \ngentleman, at least for a sea-captain this commander \nwas invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg 's sister, a \npretty young princess just turned of ten. Well ; when all \nthe wedding guests were assembled at the bride's bamboo \ncottage, this captain marches in, and being assigned the \npost of honour, placed himself over against the punch- \nbowl, and between the High Priest and his majesty the \nKing, Queequeg 's father. Grace being said, for those \npeople have their grace as well as we though Queequeg \ntold me that unlike us, who at such times look downward \nto our platters, they, on the contrary, copying the ducks, \nglance upward to the great Giver of all feasts Grace, \n\n\n\nWHEELBARROW 73 \n\nI say, being said, the High Priest opens the banquet by \nthe immemorial ceremony of the island ; that is, dipping \nhis consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl \nbefore the blessed - beverage circulates. Seeing himself \nplaced next the Priest, and noting the ceremony, and \nthinking himself being captain of a ship as having \nplain precedence over a mere island King, especially in \nthe King's own house the captain coolly proceeds to \nwash his hands in the punch-bowl ; taking it, I suppose, \nfor a huge finger-glass. ' Now/ said Queequeg, ' what \nyou tink now ? Didn't our people laugh ? ' \n\nAt last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on \nboard the schooner. Hoisting sail, it glided down the \nAcushnet river. On one side, New Bedford rose in \nterraces of streets, their ice -covered trees all glittering \nin the clear, cold air. Huge hills and mountains of casks \non casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by side \nthe world-wandering whale-ships lay silent and safely \nmoored at last ; while from others came a sound of \ncarpenters and coopers, with blended noises of fires and \nforges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new cruises \nwere on the start ; that one most perilous and long \nvoyage ended, only begins a second ; and a second ended, \nonly begins a third, and so on, forever and for aye. \nSuch is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all \nearthly effort. \n\nGaining the more open water, the bracing breeze \nwaxed fresh ; the little Moss tossed the quick foam from \nher bows, as a young colt his snortings. How I snuffed \nthat Tartar air ! how I spurned that turnpike earth ! \nthat common highway all over dented with the marks \nof slavish heels and hoofs ; and turned me to admire the \nmagnanimity of the sea which will permit no records. \n\nAt the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink \nand reel with me. His dusky nostrils swelled apart ; he \n\n\n\n74 MOBY-DICK \n\nshowed his filed and pointed teeth. On, on we flew ; and \nour offing gained, the Moss did homage to the blast ; \nducked and dived her brows as a slave before the Sultan. \nSideways leaning, we sideways darted ; every rope-yarn \ntingling like a wire ; the two tall masts buckling like \nIndian canes in land tornadoes. So full of this reeling \nscene were we, as we stood by the plunging bowsprit, \nthat for some time we did not notice the jeering glances \nof the passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled \nthat two fellow-beings should be so companionable ; as \nthough a white man were anything more dignified than \na whitewashed negro. But there were some boobies \nand bumpkins there, who, by their intense greenness, \nmust have come from the heart and centre of all verdure. \nQueequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking \nhim behind his back. I thought the bumpkin's hour of \ndoom was come. Dropping his harpoon, the brawny \nsavage caught him in his arms, and by an almost miracu- \nlous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into \nthe air ; then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset, \nthe fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet, while \nQueequeg, turning his back upon him, lighted his toma- \nhawk-pipe and passed it to me for a puff. \n\n' Capting ! capting ! ' yelled the bumpkin, running \ntoward that officer ; ' Capting, capting, here 's the \ndevil.' \n\n' Halloa, you sir/ cried the captain, a gaunt rib of the \nsea, stalking up to Queequeg, ' what in thunder do you \nmean by that ? Don't you know you might have killed \nthat chap ? ' \n\n' What him say ? ' said Queequeg, as he mildly turned \nto me. \n\n' He say,' said I, ' that you came near kill-e that man \nthere,' pointing to the still shivering greenhorn. \n\n' Kill-e/ cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face \n\n\n\nWHEELBARROW 75 \n\ninto an unearthly expression of disdain, ' ah ! him bevy \nsmall-e fish-e ; Queequeg no-kill-e so small-e fish-e ; \nQueequeg Idll-e big whale ! ' \n\n' Look you/ roared the captain, ' I '11 kill-e you, you \ncannibal, if you try any more of your tricks aboard here ; \nso mind your eye.' \n\nBut it so happened just then, that it was high time for \nthe captain to mind his own eye. The prodigious strain \nupon the mainsail had parted the weather-sheet, and the \ntremendous boom was now flying from side to side, com- \npletely sweeping the entire after part of the deck. The \npoor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, \nwas swept overboard ; all hands were in a panic ; and to \nattempt snatching at the boom to stay it, seemed madness. \nIt flew from right to left, and back again, almost in one \nticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point \nof snapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and noth- \ning seemed capable of being done ; those on deck rushed \ntoward the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it were \nthe lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the midst of \nthis consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, \nand crawling under the path of the boom, whipped hold \nof a rope, secured one end to the bulwarks, and then \nflinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the boom \nas it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar \nwas that way trapped, and all was safe. The schooner \nwas run into the wind, and while the hands were clearing \naway the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped to the waist, \ndarted from the side with a long living arc of a leap. For \nthree minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, \nthrowing his long arms straight out before him, and by \nturns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing \nfoam. I looked at the grand and glorious fellow, but saw \nno one to be saved. The greenhorn had gone down. \nShooting himself perpendicularly from the water, Quee- \n\n\n\n76 MOBY-DICK \n\nqueg now took an instant's glance around him, and seem- \ning to see just how matters were, dived down and dis- \nappeared. A few minutes more, and he rose again, one \narm still striking out, and with the other dragging a life- \nless form. The boat soon picked them up. The poor \nbumpkin was restored. All hands voted Queequeg a \nnoble trump ; the captain begged his pardon. From \nthat hour I clove to Queequeg like a barnacle ; yea, till \npoor Queequeg took his last long dive. \n\nWas there ever such unconsciousness ? He did not \nseem to think that he at all deserved a medal from the \nHumane and Magnanimous Societies. He only asked for \nwater fresh water something to wipe the brine off ; \nthat done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and \nleaning against the bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those \naround him, seemed to be saying to himself ' It 's a \nmutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians. We canni- \nbals must help these Christians. 5 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV \n\n\n\nNANTUCKET \n\nNOTHING more happened on the passage worthy the \nmentioning ; so, after a fine run, we safely arrived in \nNantucket. \n\nNantucket ! Take out your map and look at it. \nSee what a real corner of the world it occupies ; how it \nstands there, away off shore, more lonely than the Eddy- \nstone lighthouse. Look at it a mere hillock, and elbow \nof sand ; all beach, without a background. There is \nmore sand there than you would use in twenty years as a \nsubstitute for blotting-paper. Some gamesome wights \nwill tell you that they have to plant weeds there, they \ndon't grow naturally ; that they import Canada thistles ; \nthat they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a \nleak in an oil-cask ; that pieces of wood in Nantucket \nare carried about like bits of the true cross in Rome ; \nthat people there plant toadstools before their houses, \nto get under the shade in summer time ; that one blade \nof grass makes an oasis, three blades in a day's walk a \nprairie ; that they wear quicksand shoes, something like \nLaplander snow-shoes ; that they are so shut up, belted \nabout, every way enclosed, surrounded, and made an \nutter island of by the ocean, that to their very chairs and \ntables small clams will sometimes be found adhering, as \nto the backs of sea-turtles. But these extravaganzas \nonly show that Nantucket is no Illinois. \n\nLook now at the wondrous traditional story of how this \nisland was settled by the red men. Thus goes the legend. \n\n77 \n\n\n\n78 MOBY-DICK \n\nIn olden times an eagle swooped down upon the New \nEngland coast, and carried off an infant Indian in his \ntalons. With loud lament the parents saw their child \nborne out of sight over the wide waters. They resolved \nto follow in the same direction. Setting out in their \ncanoes, after a perilous passage they discovered the \nisland, and there they found an empty ivory casket, \nthe poor little Indian's skeleton. \n\nWhat wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on \na beach, should take to the sea for a livelihood ! They \nfirst caught crabs and quohogs in the sand ; grown \nbolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel ; more \nexperienced, they pushed off in boats and captured cod ; \nand at last, launching a navy of great ships on the sea, \nexplored this watery world ; put an incessant belt of cir- \ncumnavigations round it ; peeped in at Behring Straits ; \nand in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war \nwith the mightiest animated mass that has survived the \nFlood ; most monstrous and most mountainous ! That \nHimalayan, salt-sea mastodon, clothed with such por- \ntentousness of unconscious power, that his very panics \nare more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious \nassaults ! \n\nAnd thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea- \nhermits, issuing from their ant-hill in the sea, overrun \nand conquered the watery world like so many Alexanders ; \nparcelling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific, and \nIndian oceans, as the three pirate powers did Poland. Let \nAmerica add Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada ; \nlet the English over swarm all India, and hang out their \nblazing banner from the sun; two-thirds of this terr- \naqueous globe are the Nantucketer's. For the sea is his ; \nhe owns it, as Emperors own empires ; other seamen \nhaving but a right of way through it. Merchant ships \nare but extension bridges ; armed ones but floating forts ; \n\n\n\nNANTUCKET 79 \n\neven pirates and privateers, though following the sea as \nhighwaymen the road, they but plunder other ships, other \nfragments of the land like themselves, without seeking to \ndraw their living from the bottomless deep itself. The \nNantucketer, he alone resides and riots on the sea ; he \nalone, in Bible language, goes down to it in ships ; to and \nfro ploughing it as his own special plantation. There is \nhis home ; there lies his business, which a Noah's flood \nwould not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the \nmillions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks \nin the prairie ; he hides among the waves, he climbs \nthem as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he \nknows not the land ; so that when he comes to it at last, \nit smells like another world, more strangely than the \nmoon would to an Earthsman. With the landless gull, \nthat at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep \nbetween billows ; so, at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out \nof sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, \nwhile under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and \nwhales. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV \n\nCHOWDER \n\nIT was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came \nsnugly to anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore ; so \nwe could attend to no business that day, at least none \nbut a supper and a bed. The landlord of the Spouter- \nInn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey \nof the Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor \nof one of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket, and more- \nover he had assured us that Cousin Hosea, as he called \nhim, was famous for his chowders. In short, he plainly \nhinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot- \nluck at the Try Pots. But the directions he had given \nus about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard \nhand till we opened a white church to the larboard, and \nthen keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a \ncorner three points to the starboard, and that done, \nthen ask the first man we met where the place was : these \ncrooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first, \nespecially as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the \nyellow warehouse our first point of departure must be \nleft on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood \nPeter Coffin to say it was on the starboard. However, \nby dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and \nthen knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the \nway, we at last came to something which there was no \nmistaking. \n\nTwo enormous wooden pots painted black, and sus- \npended by asses' ears, swung from the cross-trees of an \n\n80 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHOWDER 81 \n\nold topmast, planted in front of an old doorway. The \nhorns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other side, \nso that this old topmast looked not a little like a gallows. \nPerhaps I was over-sensitive to such impressions at the \ntime, but I could not help staring at this gallows with a \nvague misgiving. A sort of crick was in my neck as I \ngazed up to the two remaining horns ; yes, two of them, \none for Queequeg, and one for me. It 's ominous, thinks \nI. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first \nwhaling port ; tombstones staring at me in the whale- \nman's chapel ; and here a gallows ! and a pair of pro- \ndigious black pots too ! Are these last throwing out \noblique hints touching Tophet ? \n\nI was called from these reflections by the sight of a \nfreckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown, \nstanding in the porch of the inn, under a dull red lamp \nswinging there, that looked much like an injured eye, \nand carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple \nwoollen shirt. \n\n1 Get along with ye, 5 said she to the man, ' or I '11 be \ncombing ye ! ' \n\n4 Come on, Queequeg,' said I, 'all right. There's \nMrs. Hussey.' \n\nAnd so it turned out ; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from \nhome, but leaving Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to \nattend to all his affairs. Upon making known our de- \nsires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey, postponing \nfurther scolding for the present, ushered us into a little \nroom, and seating us at a table spread with the relics \nof a recently concluded repast, turned round to us and \nsaid, ' Clam or cod ? ' \n\n' What 's that about cods, ma'am ? ' said I, with much \npoliteness. \n\n4 Clam or cod ? ' she repeated. \n\n' A clam for supper ? a cold clam ; is that what you \n\nVOL. I. F \n\n\n\n82 MOBY-DICK \n\nmean, Mrs. Hussey ? ' says I ; ' but that 's a rather cold \nand clammy reception in the winter time, ain't it, Mrs. \nHussey ? ' \n\nBut being in a great hurry to resume scolding the \nman in the purple shirt, who was waiting for it in \nthe entry, and seeming to hear nothing but the word \n' clam, 5 Mrs. Hussey hurried toward an open door \nleading to the kitchen, and bawling out ' clam for two, ' \ndisappeared. \n\n' Queequeg,' said I, ' do you think that we can make out \na supper for us both on one clam ? ' \n\nHowever, a warm savoury steam from the kitchen \nserved to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before \nus. But when that smoking chowder came in, the \nmystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends ! \nhearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, \nscarcely bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship- \nbiscuit, and salted pork cut up into little flakes ; the \nwhole enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned with \npepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the \nfrosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his \nfavourite fishing food before him, and the chowder being \nsurpassingly excellent, we dispatched it with great \nexpedition : when leaning back a moment and bethink- \ning me of Mrs. Hussey's clam and cod announcement, \nI thought I would try a little experiment. Stepping \nto the kitchen door, I uttered the word ' cod ' with great \nemphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few moments the \nsavoury steam came forth again, but with a different \nflavour, and in good time a fine cod-chowder was placed \nbefore us. \n\nWe resumed business ; and while plying our spoons \nin the bowl, thinks I to myself, I wonder now if this here \nhas any effect on the head ? What 's that stultifying \nsaying about chowder-headed people ? ' But look, \n\n\n\nCHOWDER 83 \n\nQueequeg, ain't that a live eel in your bowl ? Where 's \nyour harpoon ? ' \n\nFishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots; which well \ndeserved its name ; for the pots there were always boiling \nchowders. Chowder for breakfast, and chowder for \ndinner, and chowder for supper, till you began to look for \nfish-bones coming through your clothes. The area before \nthe house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore \na polished necklace of codfish vertebra ; and Hosea \nHussey had his account-books bound in superior old \nshark-skin. There was a fishy flavour to the milk, too, \nwhich I could not at all account for, till one morning \nhappening to take a stroll along the beach among some \nfishermen's boats, I saw Hosea 's brindled cow feeding \non fish remnants, and marching along the sand with each \nfoot in a cod's decapitated head, looking very slipshod, \nI assure ye. \n\nSupper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions \nfrom Mrs. Hussey concerning the nearest way to bed ; \nbut, as Queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs, \nthe lady reached forth her arm, and demanded his har- \npoon ; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. ' Why \nnot ? J said I ; ' every true whaleman sleeps with his \nharpoon but why not ? ' ' Because it 's dangerous, 5 \nsays she. ' Ever since young Stiggs coming from that \nunfort'nt v'y'ge of his, when he was gone four years and \na half, with only three barrels of ile, was found dead in \nmy first floor back, with his harpoon in his side ; ever \nsince then I allow no boarders to take sich dangerous \nweepons in their rooms at night. So, Mr. Queequeg ' \n(for she had learned his name), ' I will just take this \nhere iron, and keep it for you till morning. But the \nchowder ; clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast, men ? ' \n\n' Both,' says I ; ' and let 's have a couple of smoked \nherring by way of variety.' \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI \n\nTHE SHIP \n\nIN bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to \nmy surprise and no small concern, Queequeg now gave \nme to understand, that he had been diligently consulting \nYojo the name of his black little god and Yojo had \ntold him two or three times over, and strongly insisted \nupon it everyway, that instead of our going together \namong the whaling-fleet in harbour, and in concert \nselecting our craft ; instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly \nenjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly \nwith me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us ; and, \nin order to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, \nif left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, \nfor all the world as though it had turned out by chance ; \nand in that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for \nthe present irrespective of Queequeg. \n\nI have forgotten to mention that, in many things, \nQueequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of \nYojo's judgment and surprising forecast of things ; and \ncherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather \ngood sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon \nthe whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent \ndesigns. \n\nNow, this plan of Queequeg's, or rather Yojo's, touch- \ning the selection of our craft ; I did not like that plan at \nall. I had not a little relied upon Queequeg's sagacity \nto point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our \nfortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances pro- \n\n84 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SHIP 85 \n\nduced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; \nand accordingly prepared to set about this business with \na determined rushing sort of energy and vigour, that \nshould quickly settle that trifling little affair. Next \nmorning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in \nour little bedroom for it seemed that it was some sort \nof Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and \nprayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day ; how it was \nI never could find out, for, though I applied myself to \nit several times, I never could master his liturgies and \nXXXIX Articles leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on \nhis tomahawk-pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his \nsacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. \nAfter much prolonged sauntering and many random \ninquiries, I learnt that there were three ships up for \nthree-years' voyages the Devil-Dam, the Tit-bit, and \nthe Pequod. Devil-Dam, I do not know the origin of ; \nTit-bit is obvious ; Pequod, you will no doubt remember, \nwas the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts \nIndians, now extinct as the ancient Medes. I peered and \npryed about the Devil-Dam ; from her, hopped over to \nthe Tit-bit ; and, finally, going on board the Pequod, \nlooked around her for a moment, and then decided that \nthis was the very ship for us. \n\nYou may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, \nfor aught I know ; square-toed luggers ; mountainous \nJapanese junks ; butter-box galliots, and what not ; but \ntake my word for it, you never saw such a rare old craft \nas this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old \nschool, rather small if anything ; with an old-fashioned \nclaw-footed look about her. Long seasoned and weather- \nstained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her \nold hull's complexion was darkened like a French grena- \ndier's, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her \nvenerable bows looked bearded. Her masts cut some- \n\n\n\n86 MOBY-DICK \n\nwhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were \nlost overboard in a gale her masts stood stiffly up like \nthe spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her ancient \ndecks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped \nflag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. \nBut to all these her old antiquities were added new and \nmarvellous features, pertaining to the wild business that \nfor more than half a century she had followed. Old \nCaptain Peleg, many years her chief mate, before he com- \nmanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired \nseaman, and one of the principal owners of the Pequod, \nthis old Peleg, during the term of his chief mateship, had \nbuilt upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all \nover, with a quaintness both of material and device, un- \nmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake's carved \nbuckler or bedstead. She was apparelled like any bar- \nbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy with pendants \nof polished ivory. She was a thing of trophies. A canni- \nbal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones \nof her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bul- \nwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the \nlong sharp teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for \npins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to. \nThose thews ran not through base blocks of land-wood, \nbut deftly travelled over sheaves of sea -ivory. Scorning \na turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there \na tiller ; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved \nfrom the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe. \nThe helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest, \nfelt like the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed \nby clutching its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most \nmelancholy ! All noble things are touched with that. \n\nNow when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some \none having authority, in order to propose myself as a \ncandidate for the voyage, at first I saw nobody ; but I \n\n\n\nTHE SHIP 87 \n\ncould not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or rather \nwigwam, pitched a little behind the mainmast. It \nseemed only a temporary erection used in port. It was \nof a conical shape, some ten feet high ; consisting of the \nlong, huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the \nmiddle and highest part of the jaws of the right whale. \nPlanted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of these \nslabs laced together, mutually sloped toward each other, \nand at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose \nhairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some \nold Pottowottamie sachem's head. A triangular opening \nfaced toward the bows of the ship, so that the insider \ncommanded a complete view forward. \n\nAnd half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length \nfound one who by his aspect seemed to have authority ; \nand who, it being noon, and the ship's work suspended, \nwas now enjoying respite from the burden of command. \nHe was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling \nall over with curious carving ; and the bottom of which \nwas formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff \nof which the wigwam was constructed. \n\nThere was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about \nthe appearance of the elderly man I saw ; he was brown \nand brawny, like most old seamen, and heavily rolled up \nin blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style ; only there \nwas a fine and almost microscopic network of the minutest \nwrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have \narisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and \nalways looking to windward ; for this causes the muscles \nabout the eyes to become pursed together. Such eye- \nwrinkles are very effectual in a scowl. \n\n' Is this the captain of the Pequod ? ' said I, advancing \nto the door of the tent. \n\n' Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what \ndost thou want of him ? ' he demanded. \n\n\n\n88 MOBY-DICK \n\n' I was thinking of shipping.' \n\n' Thou wast, wast thou ? I see thou art no Nan- \ntucketer ever been in a stove boat ? ' \n\n' No, sir, I never have.' \n\n' Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say \neh? ' \n\n' Nothing, sir ; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. \nI 've been several voyages in the merchant service, and \nI think that \n\n' Marchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo \nto me. Dost see that leg ? I '11 take that leg away from \nthy stern, if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to \nme again. Marchant service indeed ! I suppose now \nye feel considerable proud of having served in those \nmarchant ships. But flukes ! man, what makes thee \nwant to go a-whaling, eh ? it looks a little suspicious, \ndon't it, eh ? Hast not been a pirate, hast thou ? \nDidst not rob thy last captain, didst thou ? Dost not \nthink of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea ? ' \n\nI protested my innocence of these things. I saw that \nunder the mask of these half-humorous innuendoes, this \nold seaman, as an insulated Quakerish Nantucketer, was \nfull of his insular prejudices, and rather distrustful of all \naliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard. \n\n' But what takes thee a-whaling ? I want to know that \nbefore I think of shipping ye.' \n\n4 Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to \nsee the world/ \n\n' Want to see what whaling is, eh ? Have ye clapped \neye on Captain Ahab ? ' \n\n' Who is Captain Ahab, sir ? ' \n\n4 Ay, ay, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the captain \nof this ship.' \n\n' I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to \nthe captain himself.' \n\n\n\nTHE SHIP 89 \n\n' Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg that 's who ye \nare speaking to, young man. It belongs to me and \nCaptain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted out for the voyage, \nand supplied with all her needs, including crew. We are \npart owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if \nthou wantest to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye \ndo, I can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind \nyourself to it, past backing out. Clap eye on Captain \nAhab, young man, and thou wilt finxl that he has only \none leg.' \n\n' What do you mean, sir ? Was the other one lost by \na whale ? ' \n\n' Lost by a whale ! Young man, come nearer to me : \nit was devoured, chewed up, crunched by the mon- \nstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat ! ah, ah ! ' \n\nI was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little \ntouched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, \nbut said as calmly as I could, ' What you say is no doubt \ntrue enough, sir ; but how could I know there was any \npeculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed \nI might have inferred as much from the simple fact of \nthe accident.' \n\n' Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, \nd' ye see ; thou dost not talk shark a bit. Sure, ye 've \nbeen to sea before now ; sure of that ? ' \n\n' Sir,' said I, ' I thought I told you that I had been four \nvoyages in the merchant ' \n\n' Hard down out of that ! Mind what I said about the \nmarchant service don't aggravate me I won't have it. \nBut let us understand each other. I have given thee a \nhint about what whaling is ; do ye yet feel inclined for it ? ' \n\n4 1 do, sir.' \n\n' Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a \nharpoon down a live whale's throat, and then jump \nafter it ? Answer, quick ! ' \n\n\n\n90 MOBY-DICK \n\n' I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to \ndo so ; not to be got rid of, that is ; which I don't take \nto be the fact.' \n\n6 Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go \na -whaling, to find out by experience what whaling is, \nbut ye also want to go in order to see the world ? Was \nnot that what ye said ? I thought so. Well then, just \nstep forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, \nand then back to me and tell me what ye see there.' \n\nFor a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious \nrequest, not knowing exactly how to take it, whether \nhumorously or in earnest. But concentrating all his \ncrow's feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started me on \nthe errand. \n\nGoing forward and glancing over the weather -bow, I \nperceived that the ship, swinging to her anchor with the \nflood-tide, was now obliquely pointing toward the open \nocean. The prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly \nmonotonous and forbidding ; not the slightest variety \nthat I could see. \n\n' Well, what 's the report ? ' said Peleg when I came \nback ; ' what did ye see ? ' \n\n1 Not much,' I replied 'nothing but water ; considerable \nhorizon though, and there 's a squall coming up, I think.' \n\n' Well, what dost thou think then of seeing the world ? \nDo ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, \nI eh ? Can't ye see the world where you stand ? ' \n\nI was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and \nI would ; and the Pequod was as good a ship as any I \n\n(thought the best and all this I now repeated to Peleg. \nSeeing me so determined, he expressed his willingness to \nship me. \n\n' And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off, ' he \nadded ' come along with ye.' And so saying, he led \nthe way below deck into the cabin. \n\n\n\nTHE SHIP 91 \n\nSeated on the transom was what seemed to me a most \nuncommon and surprising figure. It turned out to be \nCaptain Bildad, who along with Captain Peleg was one \nof the largest owners of the vessel ; the other shares, as \nis sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a \ncrowd of old annuitants ; widows, fatherless children, \nand chancery wards ; each owning about the value of a \ntimber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail or two in the ship. \nPeople in Nantucket invest their money in whaling- \nvessels, the same way that you do yours in approved \nstate stocks bringing in good interest. \n\nNow Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nan- \ntucketers, was a Quaker, the island having been originally \nsettled by that sect ; and to this day its inhabitants in \ngeneral retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities \nof the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified \nby things altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some \nof these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all \nsailors and whale -hunters. They are fighting Quakers ; \nthey are Quakers with a vengeance. \n\nSo that there are instances among them of men, who, \nnamed with Scripture names a singularly common \nfashion on the island and in childhood naturally imbib- \ning the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker \nidiom ; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless \nadventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with \nthese unoutgrown peculiarities a thousand bold dashes \nof character, not unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a \npoetical pagan Roman. And when these things unite \nin a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular \nbrain and a ponderous heart ; who has also by the still- \nness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the \nremotest waters, and beneath constellations never seen \nhere at the north, been led to think untraditionally and \nindependently ; receiving all nature's sweet or savage \n\n\n\n92 MOBY-DICK \n\nimpressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and \nconfiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help \nfrom accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous \nlofty language that man makes one in a whole nation's \ncensus a mighty pageant creature, formed for noble \ntragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatic- \nally regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he \nhave what seems a half- wilful over-ruling morbidness at \nthe bottom of his nature. For all men tragically great \nare made so through a certain morbidness. Be sure of \nthis, young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease. \nBut, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with \nquite another ; and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, \nit only results again from another phase of the Quaker, \nmodified by individual circumstances. \n\nLike Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, \nretired whaleman. But unlike Captain Peleg who \ncared not a rush for what are called serious things, and \nindeed deemed those self-same serious things the veriest \nof all trifles Captain Bildad had not only been originally \neducated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket \nQuakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life ; and the sight \nof many unclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn \nall that had not moved this native-born Quaker one \nsingle jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his vest. \nStill, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of \ncommon consistency about worthy Captain Bildad. \nThough refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear \narms against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably \ninvaded the Atlantic and Pacific ; and though a sworn \nfoe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight -bodied \ncoat, spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How \nnow in the contemplative evening of his days, the pious \nBildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do \nnot know ; but it did not seem to concern him much, \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SHIP 93 \n\nand very probably he had long since come to the sage and \nsensible conclusion that a Oman's religion is one thing, \nand this practical world quite another. This world pays \ndividends. Rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes \nof the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad- \nbellied waistcoat ; from that becoming boat-header, \nchief mate, and captain, and finally a shipowner ; Bildad, \nas I hinted before, had concluded his adventurous career \nby wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of \nsixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet \nreceiving of his well-earned income. \n\nNow Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of \nbeing an incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea -going days, \na bitter, hard taskmaster. They told me in Nantucket, \nthough it certainly seems a curious story, that when he \nsailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew, upon arriving \nhome, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital, \nsore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especi- v \nally for a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to \\ \nsay the least. He never used to swear, though, at his \nmen, they said ; but somehow he got an inordinate \nquantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. \nWhen Bildad was a chief mate, to have his drab-coloured \neye intently looking at you, made you feel completely \nnervous, till you could clutch something a hammer or a \nmarling-spike and go to work like mad, at something or \nother, never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished \nfrom before him. His own person was the exact embodi- \nment of his utilitarian character. On his long, gaunt \nbody he carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, \nhis chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like the worn \nnap of his broad-brimmed hat. \n\nSuch, then, was the person that I saw seated on the \ntransom when I followed Captain Peleg down into the \ncabin. The space between the decks was small ; and \n\n\n\n94 MOBY-DICK \n\nthere, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so, \nand never leaned, and this to save his coat-tails. His \nbroad-brim was placed beside him ; his legs were stiffly \ncrossed ; his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin ; \nand spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in reading \nfrom a ponderous volume. \n\n' Bildad,' cried Captain Peleg, ' at it again, Bildad, eh ? \nYe have been studying those Scriptures, now, for the last \nthirty years, to my certain knowledge. How far ye got, \nBildad ? ' \n\nAs if long habituated to such profane talk from his old \nshipmate, Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, \nquietly looked up, and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly \ntoward Peleg. \n\n4 He says he 's our man, Bildad/ said Peleg, ' he wants \nto ship. 5 \n\n' Dost thee ? ' said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning \nround to me. \n\n' I dost/ said I unconsciously, he was so intense a \nQuaker. \n\n' What do ye think of him, Bildad ? ' said Peleg. \n\n' He '11 do,' said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on \nspelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite \naudible. \n\nI thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, \nespecially as Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed \nsuch a blusterer. But I said nothing, only looking round \nme sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing \nforth the ship's articles, placed pen and ink before him, \nand seated himself at a little table. I began to think \nit was high time to settle with myself at what terms I \nwould be willing to engage for the voyage. I was already \naware that in the whaling business they paid no wages ; \nbut all hands, including the captain, received certain \nshares of the profits called lays, and that these lays were \n\n\n\nTHE SHIP 95 \n\nproportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to \nthe respective duties of the ship's company. I was also \naware that being a green-hand at whaling, my own lay \nwould not be very large ; but considering that I was used \nto the sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, \nI made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be \noffered at least the 275th lay that is, the 275th part of \nthe clear nett proceeds of the voyage, whatever that \nmight eventually amount to. And though the 275th \nlay was what they call a rather long lay, yet it was better \nthan nothing ; and if we had a lucky voyage, might \npretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it, \nnot to speak of my three years' beef and board, for which \nI would not have to pay one stiver. \n\nIt might be thought that this was a poor way to \naccumulate a princely fortune and so it was, a very poor \nway indeed. But I am one of those that never take on \nabout princely fortunes, and am quite content if the world \nis ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at \nthis grim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I \nthought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, \nbut would not have been surprised had I been offered \nthe 200th, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make. \n\nBut one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little \ndistrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits \nwas this : Ashore, I had heard something of both Captain \nPeleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad ; how that \nthey being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, there- \nfore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered \nowners, left nearly the whole management of the ship's \naffairs to these two. And I did not know but what the \nstingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about \nshipping hands, especially as I now found him on board \nthe Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading \nhis Bible as if at his own fireside. Now while Peleg was \n\n\n\n96 MOBY-DICK \n\nvainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, \nto my no small surprise, considering that he was such an \ninterested party in these proceedings ; Bildad never \nheeded us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his \nbook, ' Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, \nwhere moth ' \n\n' Well, Captain Bildad,' interrupted Peleg, ' what d' ye \nsay, what lay shall we give this young man ? ' \n\n' Thou knowest best,' was the sepulchral reply, ' the \nseven hundred and seventy-seventh wouldn't be too \nmuch, would it ? \" where moth and rust do corrupt, \nbut lay \" ' \n\nLay, indeed, thought I, and such a lay ! the seven \nhundred and seventy-seventh ! Well, old Bildad, you \nare determined that I, for one, shall not lay up many lays \nhere below, where moth and rust do corrupt. It was an \nexceedingly long lay that, indeed ; and though from the \nmagnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a lands- \nman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though \nseven hundred and seventy -seven is a pretty large num- \nber, yet, when you come to make a teenth of it, you will \nthen see, I say, that the seven hundred and seventy- \nseventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven \nhundred and seventy -seven gold doubloons ; and so I \nthought at the time. \n\n4 Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,' cried Peleg, ' thou dost \nnot want to swindle this young man ! he must have more \nthan that.' \n\n' Seven hundred and seventy -seventh,' again said \nBildad, without lifting his eyes ; and then went on \nmumbling ' for where your treasure is, there will your \nheart be also.' \n\n' I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,' \nsaid Peleg, ' do ye hear that, Bildad ? The three hundredth \nlay, I say.' \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SHIP 97 \n\nBildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly to- \nward him said, ' Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous \nheart ; but thou must consider the duty thou owest to \nthe other owners of this ship widows and orphans; many \nof them and that if we too abundantly reward the \nlabours of this young man, we may be taking the bread \nfrom those widows and those orphans. The seven \nhundred and seventy -seventh lay, Captain Peleg.' \n\n' Thou Bildad ! ' roared Peleg, starting up and clattering \nabout the cabin. ' Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had \nfollowed thy advice in these matters, I would afore now \nhad a conscience to lug about that would be heavy \nenough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round \nCape Horn.' \n\n4 Captain Peleg,' said Bildad steadily, ' thy conscience \nmay be drawing ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I \ncan't tell ; but as thou art still an impenitent man, \nCaptain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but \na leaky one ; and will in the end sink thee foundering \ndown to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.' \n\n' Fiery pit ! fiery pit ! ye insult me, man ; past all \nnatural bearing, ye insult me. It 's an all-fired outrage \nto tell any human creature that he 's bound to hell. \nFlukes and flames ! Bildad, say that again to me, and \nstart my soul-bolts, but I '11 I '11 yes, I '11 swallow a \nlive goat with all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, \nye canting, drab-coloured son of a wooden gun & straight \nwake with ye ! ' \n\nAs he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but \nwith a marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for \nthat time eluded him. \n\nAlarmed at this terrible outburst between the two \nprincipal and responsible owners of the ship, and feeling \nhalf a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so \nquestionably owned and temporarily commanded, I \n\nVOL. i. G \n\n\n\n98 MOBY-DICK \n\nstepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who, \nI made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before \nthe awakened wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, \nhe sat down again on the transom very quietly, and seemed \nto have not the slightest intention of withdrawing. He \nseemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As \nfor Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed \nno more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, \nthough he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated. \n' Whew ! ' he whistled at last ' the squall 's gone off to \nleeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at \nsharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack- \nknife here needs the grindstone. That 's he ; thank ye, \nBildad. Now then, my young man, Ishmael 's thy name, \ndidn't ye say ? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, \nfor the three hundredth lay.' \n\n' Captain Peleg,' said I, ' I have a friend with me who \nwants to ship too shall I bring him down to-morrow ? ' \n\n' To be sure,' said Peleg. ' Fetch him along, and we '11 \nlook at him.' \n\n' What lay does he want ? ' groaned Bildad, glancing \nup from the book in which he had again been burying \nhimself. \n\n* Oh ! never thee mind about that, Bildad,' said Peleg. \n' Has he ever whaled it any ? ' turning to me. \n\n' Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.' \n\n' Well, bring him along then.' \n\nAnd, after signing the papers, off I went ; nothing \ndoubting but that I had done a good morning's work, \nand that the Pequod was the identical ship that Yojo \nhad provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape. \n\nBut I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink \nme that the captain with whom I was to sail yet remained \nunseen by me ; though, indeed, in many cases, a whale- \nship will be completely fitted out, and receive all her crew \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SHIP 99 \n\non board, ere the captain makes himself visible by arriv- \ning to take command ; for sometimes these voyages are \nso prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceed- \ningly brief, that if the captain have a family, or any \nabsorbing concernment of that sort, he does not trouble \nhimself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to \nthe owners till all is ready for sea. However, it is always \nas well to have a look at him before irrevocably commit- \nting yourself into his hands. Turning back I accosted \nCaptain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be \nfound. \n\n* And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab ? It 's \nall right enough ; thou art shipped.' \n\n' Yes, but I should like to see him. 3 \n\n' But I don't think thou wilt be able to at present. I \ndon't know exactly what 's the matter with him ; but \nhe keeps close inside the house ; a sort of sick, and yet he \ndon't look so. In fact, he ain't sick ; but no, he isn't well \neither. Anyhow, young man, he won't always see me, \nso I don't suppose he will thee. He 's a queer man, \nCaptain Ahab so some think but a good one. Oh, \nthou 'It like him well enough ; no fear, no fear. He 's a \ngrand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab ; doesn't \nspeak much ; but, when he does speak, then you may well \nlisten. Mark ye, be forewarned ; Ahab 's above the \ncommon ; Ahab 's been in colleges, as well as 'mong the \ncannibals ; been used to deeper wonders than the waves ; \nfixed his fiery lance hi mightier, stranger foes than whales. \nHis lance ! ay, the keenest and the surest that out of \nall our isle ! Oh ! he ain't Captain Bildad ; no, and he \nain't Captain Peleg ; he 's Ahab, boy ; and Ahab of old, \nthou knowest, was a crowned king ! ' \n\n' And a very vile one. When that wicked king was \nslain, the dogs, did they not lick his blood ? ' \n\n1 Come hither to me hither, hither,' said Peleg, with \n\n\n\n100 MOBY-DICK \n\na significance in his eye that almost startled me. ' Look \nye, lad ; never say that on board the Pequod. Never say \nit anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself. \n'Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed \nmother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old. \nAnd yet the old squaw Tistig, at Gay Head, said that the \nname would somehow prove prophetic. And, perhaps, \nother fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to \nwarn thee. It 's a lie. I know Captain Ahab well ; I 've \nsailed with him as mate years ago ; I know what he is a \ngood man not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a \nswearing good man something like me only there 's a \ngood deal more of him. Ay, ay, I know that he was \nnever very jolly ; and I know that on the passage home, \nhe was a little out of his mind for a spell ; but it was the \nsharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought \nthat about, as anyone might see. I know, too, that ever \nsince he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, \nhe ? s been a kind of moody desperate moody, and savage \nsometimes ; but that will all pass off. And once for all, \nlet me tell thee and assure thee, young man, it 's better \nto sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad \none. So good-bye to thee and wrong not Captain \nAhab, because he happens to have a wicked name. Be- \nsides, my boy, he has a wife not three voyages wedded \na_ sweet, resigned girl. Think of that ; by that sweet \ngirl that old man has a child : hold ye then there can be \nany utter, hopeless harm in Ahab ? No, no, my lad ; \nstricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his humanities ! ' \n\nAs I walked away, I was full of thoughtfuhiess ; what \nhad been incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, \nfilled me with a certain wild vagueness of painfulness \nconcerning him. And somehow, at the time, I felt a \nsympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don't know \nwhat, ^unless it was the cruel loss of his leg. And yet I \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SHIP 101 \n\nalso felt a strange awe of him ; but that sort of awe, \nwhich I cannot at all describe, was not exactly awe ; I \ndo not know what it was. But I felt it ; and it did not \ndisincline me toward him ; though I felt impatience \nat what seemed like mystery in him, so imperfectly as \nhe was known to me then. However, my thoughts were \nat length carried in other directions, so that for the present \ndark Ahab slipped my mind. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII \n\nTHE RAMADAN \n\nAs Queequeg 's Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, \nwas to continue all day, I did not choose to disturb him \ntill toward night -fall ; for I cherish the greatest respect \ntoward everybody's religious obligations, never mind \nhow comical, and could not find it in my heart to under- \nvalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad- \nstool ; or those other creatures in certain parts of our \nearth, who with a degree of footmanism quite unpre- \ncedented in other planets, bow down before the torso \nof a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of \nthe inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his \nname. \n\nI say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be \ncharitable in these things, and not fancy ourselves so \nvastly superior to other mortals, pagans and what not, \nbecause of their half -crazy conceits on these subjects. \nThere was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most \nabsurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan ; but what \nof that ? Queequeg thought he knew what he was about, \nI suppose ; he seemed to be content ; and there let him \nrest. All our arguing with him would not avail ; let him \nbe, I say : and Heaven have mercy on us all Presby- \nterians and pagans alike for we are all somehow dread- \nfully cracked about the head, and sadly need mending. \n\nToward evening, when I felt assured that all his \nperformances and rituals must be over, I went up to his \nroom and knocked at the door ; but no answer. I tried \n102 \n\n\n\ni \n\n\n\nTHE RAMADAN 103 \n\nto open it, but it was fastened inside. ' Queequeg,' said I \nsoftly through the keyhole : all silent. ' I say, Quee- \nqueg ! why don't you speak ? It 's I Ishmael.' But \nall remained still as before. I began to grow alarmed. I \nhad allowed him such abundant time ; I thought he might \nhave had an apoplectic fit. I looked through the key- \nhole ; but the door opening into an odd corner of the \nroom, the keyhole prospect was but a crooked and sinister \none. I could only see part of the foot-board of the bed \nand a line of the wall, but nothing more. I was surprised \nto behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of Quee- \nqueg 's harpoon, which the landlady the evening previous \nhad taken from him, before our mounting to the chamber. \nThat 's strange, thought I ; but at any rate, since the \nharpoon stands yonder, and he seldom or never goes \nabroad without it, therefore he must be inside here, and \nno possible mistake. \n\n' Queequeg ! Queequeg ! ' all still. Something must \nhave happened. Apoplexy ! I tried to burst open the \ndoor ; but it stubbornly resisted. Running downstairs, \nI quickly stated my suspicions to the first person I met \nthe chambermaid. ' La ! la ! ' she cried, ' I thought \nsomething must be the matter. I went to make the bed \nafter breakfast, and the door was locked ; and not a \nmouse to be heard ; and it 's been just so silent ever since. \nBut I thought, maybe, you had both gone off and locked \nyour baggage in for safe keeping. La ! la, ma'am ! \nMistress ! murder ! Mrs. Hussey ! apoplexy ! ' and \nwith these cries, she ran toward the kitchen, I following. \n\nMrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one \nhand and a vinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken \naway from the occupation of attending to the castors, \nand scolding her little black boy meantime. \n\n' Wood-house ! ' cried I, ' which way to it ? Run, for \nGod's sake, and fetch something to pry open the door \n\n\n\n104 MOBY-DICK \n\nthe axe ! the axe ! he 's had a stroke ; depend upon \nit ! ' and so saying I was unmethodically rushing up- \nstairs again empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed \nthe mustard-pot and vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor \nof her countenance. \n\n' What J s the matter with you, young man ? ' \n\n' Get the axe ! For God's sake, run for the doctor, \nsomeone, while I pry it open ! ' \n\n' Look here/ said the landlady, quickly putting down \nthe vinegar-cruet, so as to have one hand free ; ' look \nhere ; are you talking about prying open any of my \ndoors ? ' and with that she seized my arm. ' What 's \nthe matter with you ? What 's the matter with you, \nshipmate ? ' \n\nIn as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her \nto understand the whole case. Unconsciously clapping \nthe vinegar-cruet to one side of her nose, she ruminated \nfor an instant ; then exclaimed 4 No ! I haven't seen it \nsince I put it there.' Running to a little closet under the \nlanding of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told \nme that Queequeg's harpoon was missing. ' He 's killed \nhimself,' she cried. ' It 's unfort'nate Stiggs done over \nagain there goes another counterpane God pity his \npoor mother ! it will be the ruin of my house. Has \nthe poor lad a sister ? Where 's that girl ? there, Betty, \ngo to Snarles the Painter, and tell him to paint me a sign, \nwith \" no suicides permitted here, and no smoking in \nthe parlour \" ; might as well kill both birds at once. \nKill ? The Lord be merciful to his ghost ! What 's \nthat noise there ? You, young man, avast there ! ' \n\nAnd running after me, she caught me as I was again \ntrying to force open the door. \n\n' I won't allow it ; I won't have my premises spoiled. \nGo for the locksmith, there 's one about a mile from here. \nBut avast ! ' putting her hand in her side-pocket, ' here 's \n\n\n\nTHE RAMADAN 105 \n\na key that '11 fit, I guess ; let 's see.' And with that, she \nturned it in the lock ; but, alas ! Queequeg 's supple- \nmental bolt remained unwithdrawn within. \n\n6 Have to burst it open,' said I, and was running down \nthe entry a little, for a good start, when the landlady \ncaught at me, again vowing I should not break down her \npremises ; but I tore from her, and with a sudden bodily \nrush dashed myself full against the mark. \n\nWith a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the \nknob slamming against the wall, sent the plaster to the \nceiling ; and there, good heavens ! there sat Queequeg, \naltogether cool and self-collected ; right in the middle \nof the room ; squatting on his hams, and holding Yojo \non top of his head. He looked neither one way nor the \nother way, but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign \nof active life. \n\n' Queequeg/ said I, going up to him, ' Queequeg, what 's \nthe matter with you ? ' \n\n' He hain't been a-sittin* so all day, has he ? ' said the \nlandlady. \n\nBut all we said, not a word could we drag out of him ; \nI almost felt like pushing him over, so as to change his \nposition, for it was almost intolerable, it seemed so pain- \nfully and unnaturally constrained ; especially, as in all \nprobability he had been sitting so for upward of eight or \nten hours, going too without his regular meals. \n\n'Mrs. Hussey,' said I, 'he's alive, at all events; so \nleave us, if you please, and I will see to this strange affair \nmyself.' \n\nClosing the door upon the landlady, I endeavoured to \n>revail upon Queequeg to take a chair ; but in vain. \nThere he sat ; and all he could do for all my polite \narts and blandishments he would not move a peg, nor \nsay a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my \npresence in any the slightest way. \n\n\n\n106 MOBY-DICK \n\nI wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his \nRamadan ; do they fast on their hams that way in his \nnative island ? It must be so ; yes, it 's part of his \ncreed, I suppose ; well, then, let him rest ; he '11 get up \nsooner or later, no doubt. It can't last for ever, thank \nGod, and his Ramadan only comes once a year ; and I \ndon't believe it 's very punctual then. \n\nI went down to supper. After sitting a long time \nlistening to the long stories of some sailors who had just \ncome from a plum-pudding voyage, as they called it (that \nis, a short whaling voyage in a schooner or brig, confined \nto the north of the Line, in the Atlantic Ocean only) ; after \nlistening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven \no'clock, I went upstairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure \nby this time Queequeg must certainly have brought his \nRamadan to a termination. But no ; there he was just \nwhere I had left him ; he had not stirred an inch. I began \nto grow vexed with him ; it seemed so downright sense- \nless and insane to be sitting there all day and half the \nnight on his hams in a cold room, holding a piece of wood \non his head. \n\n' For heaven's sake, Queequeg, get up and shake your- \nself ; get up and have some supper. You 11 starve ; \nyou '11 kill yourself, Queequeg.' But not a word did he \nreply. \n\nDespairing of him, therefore, I deter mined to go to bed \nand to sleep ; and no doubt, before a great while, he \nwould follow me. But previous to turning in, I took my \nheavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as it \npromised to be a very cold night ; and he had nothing \nbut his ordinary round jacket on. For some time, do \nall I would, I could not get into the faintest doze. I had \nblown out the candle ; and the mere thought of Queequeg \nnot four feet off sitting there in that uneasy position, \nstark alone in the cold and dark ; this made me really \n\n\n\nTHE RAMADAN 107 \n\nwretched. Think of it ; sleeping all night in the same \nroom with a wide-awake pagan on his hams in this dreary, \nunaccountable Ramadan ! \n\nBut somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing \nmore till break of day ; when, looking over the bedside, \nthere squatted Queequeg, as if he had been screwed down \nto the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of sun \nentered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating \njoints, but with a cheerful look ; limped toward me where \nI lay ; pressed his forehead again against mine ; and said \nhis Ramadan was over. \n\nNow, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any \nperson's religion, be it what it may, so long as that person \ndoes not kill or insult any other person, because that other \nperson don't believe it also. But when a man's religion \nbecomes really frantic ; when it is a positive torment to \nhim ; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncom- \nfortable inn to lodge in ; then I think it high time to take \nthat individual aside and argue the point with him. \n\nAnd just so I now did with Queequeg. ' Queequeg,' \nsaid I, ' get into bed now, and lie and listen to me.' I \nthen went on, beginning with the rise and progress of \nthe primitive religions, and coming down to the various \nreligions of the present time, during which time I laboured \nto show Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and \nprolonged ham-squattings in cold, cheerless rooms were \nstark nonsense ; bad for the health ; useless for the soul ; \nopposed, in short, to the obvious laws of hygiene and \ncommon-sense. I told him, too, that he being in other \nthings such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage, \nit pained me, very badly pained me, to see him now so \ndeplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his. \nBesides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in ; hence \nthe spirit caves in ; and all thoughts born of a fast must \nnecessarily be half -starved. This is the reason why most \n\n\n\n\n\n\n108 MOBY-DICK \n\ndyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy notions \nabout their hereafters. In one word, Queequeg, said I, \nrather digressively ; hell is an idea first born on an un- \ndigested apple-dumpling ; and since then perpetuated \nthrough the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Bamadans. \n\nI then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever \ntroubled with dyspepsia ; expressing the idea very plainly, \nso that he could take it in. He said no ; only upon one \nmemorable occasion. It was after a great feast given \nby his father the King, on the gaming of a great battle \nwherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two \no'clock in the afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that \nvery evening. \n\n4 No more, Queequeg,' said I, shuddering ; 'that will \ndo ' ; for I knew the inferences without his further hint- \ning them. I had seen a sailor who had visited that very \nisland, and he told me that it was the custom, when a \ngreat battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the \nslain in the yard or garden of the victor ; and then, one \nby one, they were placed in great wooden trenchers, and \ngarnished round like a pilau, with breadfruit and cocoa- \nnuts ; and with some parsley in their mouths, were sent \nround with the victor's compliments to all his friends, \njust as though these presents were so many Christmas \nturkeys. \n\nAfter all, I do not think that my remarks about religion \nmade much impression upon Queequeg. Because, in \nthe first place, he somehow seemed dull of hearing on \nthat important subject, unless considered from his own \npoint of view ; and, in the second place, he did not more \nthan one-third understand me, couch my ideas simply as \nI would ; and, finally, he no doubt thought he knew a \ngood deal more about the true religion than I did. He \nlooked at me with a sort of condescending concern and \ncompassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such \n\n\n\nTHE RAMADAN 109 \n\na sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to \nevangelical pagan piety. \n\nAt last we rose and dressed ; and Queequeg, taking a \nprodigiously hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so \nthat the landlady should not make much profit by reason \nof his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the Pequod, \nsauntering along, and picking our teeth with halibut \nbones. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII \n\nHIS MARK \n\nAs we were walking down the end of the wharf toward \nthe ship, Queequeg carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg \nin his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam, saying \nhe had not suspected my friend was a cannibal, and \nfurthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on \nboard that craft, unless they previously produced their \npapers. \n\n' What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg ? ' said I, \nnow jumping on the bulwarks, and leaving my comrade \nstanding on the wharf. \n\n' I mean,' he replied, ' he must show his papers.' \n\n' Yea,' said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking \nhis head from behind Peleg 's, out of the wigwam. ' He \nmust show that he 's converted. Son of darkness/ he \nadded, turning to Queequeg, c art thou at present in \ncommunion with any Christian church ? ' \n\n' Why/ said I, ' he 's a member of the First Congrega- \ntional Church/ Here be it said, that many tattooed \nsavages sailing in Nantucket ships at last come to be \nconverted into the churches. \n\n' First Congregational Church/ cried Bildad, ' what ! \nthat worships in Deacon Deuteronomy Cole man's meeting- \nhouse ? ' and so saying, taking out his spectacles, he rubbed \nthem with his great yellow bandana handkerchief, and \nputting them on very carefully, came out of the wigwam, \nand leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long \nlook at Queequeg. \nIIP \n\n\n\nHIS MARK 111 \n\n* How long hath he been a member ? ' he then said, \nturning to me ; ' not very long, I rather guess, young \nman.' \n\n4 No/ said Peleg, ' and he hasn't been baptized right \neither, or it would have washed some of that devil's blue \noff his face.' \n\n' Do tell, now/ cried Bildad, ' is this Philistine a \nregular member of Deacon Deuteronomy's meeting ? \nI never saw him going there, and I pass it every Lord's \nday.' \n\n' I don't know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy \nor his meeting/ said I, ' all I know is, that Queequeg here \nis a born member of the First Congregational Church. \nHe is a deacon himself, Queequeg is.' \n\n' Young man/ said Bildad sternly, ' thou art skylarking \nwith me explain thyself, thou young Hittite. What \nchurch dost thee mean ? answer me.' \n\nFinding myself thus hard pushed, I replied, ' I mean, sir, \nthe same ancient Catholic Church to which you and I, \nand Captain Peleg there, and Queequeg here, and all of \nus, and every mother's son and soul of us belong ; the \ngreat and everlasting First Congregation of this whole \nworshipping world ; we all belong to that ; only some of \nus cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the \ngrand belief ; in that we all join hands/ \n\n' Splice, thou mean'st splice hands/ cried Peleg, draw- \ning nearer. ' Young man, you 'd better ship for a mis- \nsionary, instead of a foremast hand ; I never heard a \nbetter sermon. Deacon Deuteronomy why Father \nMapple himself couldn't beat it, and he 's reckoned some- \nthing. Come aboard, come aboard ; never mind about \nthe papers. I say, tell Quohog there what 's that you \ncall him ? tell Quohog to step along. By the great \nanchor, what a harpoon he 's got there ! looks like good \nstuff that ; and he handles it about right. I say, Quohog, \n\n\n\n112 MOBY-DICK \n\nor whatever your name is, did you ever stand in the head \nof a whale-boat ? did you ever strike a fish ? ' \n\nWithout saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of \nway, jumped upon the bulwarks, from thence into the \nbows of one of the whale-boats hanging to the side ; and \nthen bracing his left knee, and poising his harpoon, cried \nout in some such way as this : \n\n' Cap'ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere ? \nYou see him ? well, spose him one whale eye, well, den ! ' \nand taking sharp aim at it, he darted the iron right over \nold Bildad's broad brim, clean across the ship's decks, \nand struck the glistening tar spot out of sight/ \n\n' Now, 5 said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, \n* spos-ee him whale-e eye ; why, dad whale dead.' \n\n' Quick, Bildad,' said Peleg to his partner, who, aghast \nat the close vicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated \ntoward the cabin gangway. ' Quick, I say, you, Bildad, \nand get the ship's papers. We must have Hedgehog \nthere, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats. Look ye, \nQuohog, we '11 give ye the ninetieth lay, and that 's \nmore than ever was given a harpooneer yet out of \nNantucket.' \n\nSo down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy \nQueequeg was soon enrolled among the same ship's \ncompany to which I myself belonged. \n\nWhen all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got \neverything ready for signing, he turned to me and said, \n' I guess, Quohog there don't know how to write, does he ? \nI say, Quohog, blast ye ! dost thou sign thy name or \nmake thy mark ? ' \n\nBut at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or \nthrice before taken part in similar ceremonies, looked \nno ways abashed ; but taking the offered pen, copied \nupon the paper, in the proper place, an exact counterpart \nof a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm ; \n\n\n\nHIS MARK 113 \n\nso that through Captain Peleg's obstinate mistake touch- \ning his appellative, it stood something like this : \n\nQuohog. \nhis >J< mark. \n\nMeanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and stead- \nfastly eyeing Queequeg, and at last rising solemnly and \nfumbling in the huge pockets of his broad-skirted drab \ncoat, took out a bundle of tracts, and selecting one entitled \n' The Latter Day Coming ; or No Time to Lose,' placed \nit in Queequeg 's hands, and then grasping them and the \nbook with both his, looked earnestly into his eyes, and \nsaid, ' Son of darkness, I must do my duty by thee ; I am \npart owner of this ship, and feel concerned for the souls of \nall its crew ; if thou still clingest to thy pagan ways, which \nI sadly fear, I beseech thee, remain not for aye a Belial \nbondsman. Spurn the idol Bell, and the hideous dragon ; \nturn from the wrath to come ; mind thine eye, I say ; oh ! \ngoodness gracious ! steer clear of the fiery pit ! ' \n\nSomething of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad's \nlanguage, heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and \ndomestic phrases. \n\n' Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling \nour harpooneer,' cried Peleg. ' Pious harpooneers never \nmake good voyagers it takes the shark out of 'em ; no \nharpooneer is worth a straw who ain't pretty sharkish. \nThere was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest boat- \nheader out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard ; he joined \nthe meeting, and never came to good. He got so \nfrightened about his plaguy soul, that he shrinked and \nsheered away from whales, for fear of after-claps, in case \nhe got stove and went to Davy Jones.' \n\nc Peleg ! Peleg ! ' said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, \n'thou thyself, as I myself, hast seen many a perilous \ntime ; thou knowest, Peleg, what it is to have the fear of \n\nVOL. I. H \n\n\n\n114 MOBY-DICK \n\ndeath ; how, then, can'st thou prate in this ungodly guise. \nThou beliest thine own heart, Peleg. Tell me, when this \nsame Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that \ntyphoon on Japan, that same voyage when thou went \nmate with Captain Ahab, didst thou not think of Death \nand the Judgment then ? ' \n\n' Hear him, hear him now, ' cried Peleg, marching across \nthe cabin, and thrusting his hands far down into his \npockets, ' hear him, all of ye. Think of that ! When \nevery moment we thought the ship would sink ! Death \nand the Judgment then ? What ? With all three masts \nmaking such an everlasting thundering against the side ; \nand every sea breaking over us, fore and aft. Think of \nDeath and the Judgment then ? No ! no time to think \nabout Death then. Life was what Captain Ahab and I \nwas thinking of ; and how to save all hands how to rig \njury-masts how to get into the nearest port ; that was \nwhat I was thinking of. } \n\nBildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked \non deck, where we followed him. There he stood, very \nquietly overlooking some sail-makers who were mending \na topsail in the waist. Now and then he stooped to pick \nup a patch, or save an end of the tarred twine, which \notherwise might have been wasted. \n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX \n\nTHE PEOPHET \n\n' SHIPMATES, have ye shipped in that ship ? ' \n\nQueequeg and I had just left the Pequod, and were \nsauntering away from the water, for the moment each \noccupied with his own thoughts, when the above words \nwere put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us, \nlevelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question. \nHe was but shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and \npatched trowsers ; a rag of a black handkerchief investing \nhis neck. A confluent small-pox had in all directions \nflowed over his face, and left it like the complicated ribbed \nbed of a torrent, when the rushing waters have been \ndried up. \n\n4 Have ye shipped in her ? ' he repeated. \n\n4 You mean the ship Pequod, I suppose,' said I, trying \nto gain a little more time for an uninterrupted look at him. \n\n' Ay, the Pequod that ship there/ he said, drawing \nback his whole arm, and then rapidly shoving it straight \nout from him, with the fixed bayonet of his pointed \nfinger darted full at the object. \n\n' Yes,' said I, ' we have just signed the articles.' \n\n' Anything down there about your souls ? ' \n\n' About what ? ' \n\n' Oh, perhaps you hav'n't got any,' he said quickly. \nNo matter though, I know many chaps that hav'n't got \n\nly, good luck to 'em ; and they are all the better off for \nit. A soul 's a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon.' \n\n' What are you jabbering about, shipmate ? ' said I. \n\n115 \n\n! \n\n\n\n116 MOBY-DICK \n\n' He 's got enough, though, to make up for all de- \nficiencies of that sort in other chaps,' abruptly said the \nstranger, placing a nervous emphasis upon the word he. \n\n' Queequeg,' said I, ' let 's go ; this fellow has broken \nloose from somewhere ; he 's talking about something \nand somebody we don't know.' \n\n' Stop ! ' cried the stranger. ' Ye said true ye \nhav'n't seen Old Thunder yet, have ye ? ' \n\n' Who 's Old Thunder ? ' said I, again riveted with the \ninsane earnestness of his manner. \n\n' Captain Ahab.' \n\n' What ! the captain of our ship, the Pequod ? ' \n\n' Ay, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by \nthat name. Ye hav'n't seen him yet, have ye ? ' \n\n' No, we hav'n't. He 's sick, they say, but is getting \nbetter, and will be all right again before long.' \n\n4 All right again before long ! ' laughed the stranger, \nwith a solemnly derisive sort of laugh. ' Look ye ; when \nCaptain Ahab is all right, then this left arm of mine will \nbe all right ; not before.' \n\ni What do you know about him ? ' \n\n' What did they tell you about him ? Say that ! ' \n\n' They didn't tell much of anything about him ; only \nI 've heard that he 's a good whale -hunter, and a good \ncaptain to his crew.' \n\n' That 's true, that 's true yes, both true enough. \nBut you must jump when he gives an order. Step and \ngrowl ; growl and go that 's the word with Captain \nAhab. But nothing about that thing that happened to \nhim off Cape Horn, long ago, when he lay like dead for \nthree days and nights ; nothing about that deadly scrim- \nmage with the Spaniard afore the altar in Santa ? heard \nnothing about that, eh ? Nothing about the silver cala- \nbash he spat into ? And nothing about his losing his \nleg last voyage, according to the prophecy. Didn't ye \n\n\n\nTHE PROPHET 117 \n\nhear a word about them matters and something more, eh ? \nNo, I don't think ye did ; how could ye ? Who knows \nit ? Not all Nantucket, I guess. But hows'ever, may- \nhap, ye Ve heard tell about the leg, and how he lost it ; \nay> ye have heard of that, I dare say. Oh yes, that \nevery one knows a 'most I mean they know he 's only \none leg ; and that a parmacetti took the other off.' \n\n4 My friend/ said I, ' what all this gibberish of yours is \nabout, I don't know, and I don't much care ; for it seems \nto me that you must be a little damaged in the head. \nBut if you are speaking of Captain Ahab of that ship there, \nthe Pequod, then let me tell you, that I know all about \nthe loss of his leg.' \n\n' All about it, eh sure you do ? all ? ' \n\n* Pretty sure.' \n\nWith finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the \nbeggar-like stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled \nre very ; then starting a little, turned and said, ' Ye Ve \nshipped, have ye ? Names down on the papers ? Well, \nwell, what 's signed, is signed ; and what 's to be, will be ; \nand then again, perhaps it won't be, after all. Anyhow, \nit's all fixed and arranged a 'ready ; and some sailors \nor other must go with him, I suppose ; as well these as \nany other men, God pity 'em ! Morning to ye, shipmates, \nmorning ; the ineffable heavens bless ye ; I 'm sorry I \nstopped ye.' \n\n' Look here, friend,' said I, 'if you have anything im- \nportant to tell us, out with it ; but if you are only trying \nto bamboozle us, you are mistaken in your game ; that 's \nall I have to say.' \n\n' And it 's said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk \nup that way ; you are just the man for him the likes of \nye. Morning to ye, shipmates, morning ! Oh ! when ye get \nthere, tell 'em I Ve concluded not to make one of 'em.' \n\n' Ah, my dear fellow, you can't fool us that way you \n\n\n\n118 MOBY-DICK \n\ncan't fool us. It is the easiest thing in the world for a man \nto look as if he had a great secret in him.' \n\n' Morning to ye, shipmates, morning.' \n\n' Morning it is,' said I. ' Come along, Queequeg, let 's \nleave this crazy man. But stop, tell me your name, will \nyou?' \n\n^Elijah/ \n\nElijah ! thought I, and we walked away, both comment- \ning, after each other's fashion, upon this ragged old sailor ; \nand agreed that he was nothing but a humbug, trying to \nbe a bugbear. But we had not gone perhaps above a \nhundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and look- \ning back as I did so, who should be seen but Elijah follow- \ning us, though at a distance. Somehow, the sight of him \nstruck me so, that I said nothing to Queequeg of his being \nbehind, but passed on with my comrade, anxious to see \nwhether the stranger would turn the same corner that we \ndid. He did ; and then it seemed to me that he was \ndogging us, but with what intent I could not for the life \nof me imagine. This circumstance, coupled with his \nambiguous, half-hinting, half-revealing, shrouded sort of \ntalk, now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments \nand half -apprehensions, and all connected with the \nPequod ; and Captain Ahab ; and the leg he had lost ; \nand the Cape Horn fit ; and the silver calabash ; and what \nCaptain Peleg had said of him, when I left the ship the \nday previous ; and the prediction of the squaw Tistig ; \nand the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail ; and a \nhundred other shadowy things. \n\nI was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah \nwas really dogging us or not, and with that intent crossed \nthe way with Queequeg, and on that side of it retraced our \nsteps. But Elijah passed on, without seeming to notice \nus. This relieved me ; and once more, and finally as it \nseemed to me, I pronounced him in my heart, a humbug. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX \n\n\n\nALL ASTIR \n\nA DAY or two passed, and there was great activity aboard \nthe Pequod. Not only were the old sails being mended, \nbut new sails were coming on board, and bolts of canvas, \nand coils of rigging ; in short, everything betokened that \nthe ship's preparations were hurrying to a close. Captain \nPeleg seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his wigwam \nkeeping a sharp look-out upon the hands : Bildad did all \nthe purchasing and providing at the stores ; and the men \nemployed in the hold and on the rigging were working till \nlong after night-fall. \n\nOn the day following Queequeg's signing the articles, \nword was\n\nFalse\nTrue\n",
