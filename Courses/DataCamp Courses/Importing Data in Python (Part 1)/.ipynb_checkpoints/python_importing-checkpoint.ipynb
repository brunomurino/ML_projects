      "to my amazement, contented himself with restricting \n",
      "his ablutions to his chest, arms, and hands. He then \n",
      "donned his waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap \n",
      "on the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water and \n",
      "commenced lathering his face. I was watching to see \n",

      "I HAD not been seated very long ere a man of a certain \n",
      "venerable robustness entered ; immediately as the storm- \n",
      "pelted door flew back upon admitting him, a quick regard- \n",
      "ful eyeing of him by all the congregation sufficiently \n",
      "attested that this fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, \n",
      "it was the famous Father Mapple, so called by the whale- \n",
      "men, among whom he was a very great favourite. He \n",
      "had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for \n",
      "many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry. \n",
      "At the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the \n",
      "hardy winter of a healthy old age ; that sort of old age \n",
      "which seems merging into a second flowering youth, for \n",
      "among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain \n",

      "verdure peeping forth even beneath February's snow. \n",
      "No one having previously heard his history, could for \n",
      "the first time behold Father Mapple without the utmost \n",
      "interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical \n",
      "peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous \n",
      "maritime life he had led. When he entered I observed \n",
      "that he carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come \n",
      "in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting \n",
      "sleet, and his great pilot-cloth jacket seemed almost to \n",
      "drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had \n",
      "absorbed. However, hat and coat and overshoes were \n",
      "one by one removed, and hung up in a little space in an \n",
      "adjacent corner ; when, arrayed in a decent suit, he \n",
      "quietly approached the pulpit. \n",

      "Like most old-fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, \n",
      "and since a regular stairs to such a height would, by its \n",
      "long angle with the floor, seriously contract the already \n",
      "small area of the chapel, the architect, it seemed, had \n",
      "acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and finished the \n",
      "pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side \n",
      "ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at \n",
      "sea. The wife of a whaling-captain had provided the chapel \n",
      "with a handsome pair of red worsted man-ropes for this \n",
      "ladder, which, being itself nicely headed, and stained with \n",
      "a mahogany colour, the whole contrivance, considering \n",
      "what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad \n",
      "taste. Halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder, \n",
      "and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs \n",
      "of the man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upward, \n",
      "and then with a truly sailor-like but still reverential \n",
      "dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the steps as if \n",
      "ascending the main -top of his vessel. \n",
      "\n",
      "The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually \n",
      "the case with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, \n",
      "only the rounds were of wood, so that at every step there \n",
      "was a joint. At my first glimpse of the pulpit, it had not \n",

      "Yes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the word, \n",

      "perennial well of water within the walls. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the side ladder was not the only strange feature \n",

      "of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back was adorned \n",
      "with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating \n",
      "against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and \n",
      "snowy breakers. But high above the flying scud and \n",
      "dark-rolling clouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight, \n",
      "from which beamed forth an angel's face ; and this bright \n",
      "face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ship's tossed \n",
      "deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into the \n",

      "matched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake's carved \n",
      "buckler or bedstead. She was apparelled like any bar- \n",

      "of polished ivory. She was a thing of trophies. A canni- \n",
      "bal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones \n",
      "of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bul- \n",
